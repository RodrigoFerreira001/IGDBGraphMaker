Experience a survival adventure like never before through colorful 3D graphics and the uniquely interactive capabilities of the Wii. You find yourself stranded on a mysterious island filled with lush forests, a sunken ship, ancient ruins, and an active volcano. With the help of a trusty pet and a new friend, you\u2019ll explore the mysteries of the island to find a way out or make a new life for yourselves there forever. The first console version of the series greatly upgrades the visual quality and depth of the game, immersing the player in a survival adventure like never before. Vibrant 3D graphics paint the island environment, weather systems, and various items as more life-like than ever. Full use of Wii-mote and Nunchuk controls allow you to experience realistic movements with a variety of mini-games including fishing, carpentry, fire-making and more. An island tutorial and a greater focus on exploration enhances the accessibility and fun factor for new players. Dependable pets improve item gathering and provide entertainment by playing music or dancing with you. Recruit a friend for around 40 mini-games, including new, cooperative games - the better you play, the bigger your reward",
