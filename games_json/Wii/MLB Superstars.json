Can you feed them all in time? Look at the bubble above a fan\u2019s head to see what kind of snack he wants. Aim and launch the correct food at the fans to earn points. \n \nBaseball Golf - Bat, bunt, and toss the ball to sink it in the hole in the fewest strokes possible! Multiple Wii Remote motions will be used to complete a hole. Swinging motions for drives, throwing for mid range shots and once on the green you\u2019ll utilize a bunting motion to finish off the hole. \n \nMarbles - Try to knock marbles out of the circle in this baseball themed take on a classic childhood game!

These Pi\u00f1atas are needed to play the Pi\u00f1ata Smash mini game. You\u2019ve got 30 seconds to swing the Wii Remote to smash the Pi\u00f1ata and reveal the prizes within. \n \nTrophy Room - Head on into the Trophy Room to see the prizes you have won by completing and winning the mini games. \n \nLocker Room - Here you can equip your character with all of the unlockable gear you\u2019ve discovered along the way!
