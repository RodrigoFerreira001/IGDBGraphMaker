    "summary": "You might be a nerdy wallflower, but you're about to become the coolest cat out there. Chrysler Classic Racing is set in America during the car-crazed era of 1950s and 1960s, and you're on a mission to become the \"King of Cool\" by redefining not only your own style, but creating the hippest racing vehicle on the road! With just enough dough in your pocket to buy an entry-level Chrysler, take part in \"after-hours\" races. Win some cash and buy new cars, better engines sweet decals, or faster tires. Or make yourself look cooler with a sleek new haircut, more fashionable threads, and swankier sunglasses. If your car looks hot and your style is slick, you could just become the \"King of Cool.\" \n \nHaving a cool car, lapping opponents, and winning races by a substantial margin are just some of the ways to be awarded Cool Points. \nUse Cool Points to customize your character-improve haircuts, add cool facial hair, buy hot new clothes, or update to stylish shades. \nCustomize your classic Chrysler vehicles including the Barracuda and the Belveder, change the tires, suspension, and steering, not to mention adding cool paint decals and chrome finishes. \nIncorporated mini-games are an essential part of the gameplay and storyline-like bartering for cars and racing for pink slips.",
