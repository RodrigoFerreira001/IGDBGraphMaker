Players score points by accurately moving their bodies in time with the music and scrolling indicators. Some song lyrics contain references to suggestive material (e.g., \u201cEverybody screamed when I kissed the teacher,\u201d \u201cLove-makin' in a park,\u201d \u201cI can see what you want/But you seem pretty young/To be searching for that kind of fun\u201d). The game also includes photo galleries that depict band/crew members holding cigarettes."
