A variety of courses located throughout the world send gamers speeding along the Thames River, careening down the Canadian Rockies, and veering through the Venetian canals. A stunt mode lets creative players use their Wii Remote to perform numerous airborne tricks, solo gamers can try out Championship Mode and Time Trial, or they can join a friend for multiplayer racing.",
