    "summary": "The gameplay is similar to the SingStar set of video games. Players are required to sing along with music in order to score points, matching pitch and rhythm. The game has anticheat technology whereby tapping or humming will register on the screen but no points will be awarded. We Sing Down Under also contains the addition of 'Star Notes' that allow the player to score even more points by matching the pitch and rhythm of certain hard to score parts of songs. \n \n30 full licensed songs with music videos where available \nSolo Mode \nMultiplayer modes - Group Battle, We Sing, Versus, Pass the Mic, First to X, Expert, Blind, Marathon. \nReal Karaoke mode \nJukebox mode \nSinging Lessons \nAward System \nCustomisable backgrounds \nFour Microphones \nIntegrates with a USB hub \nDue to hardware limitations with the Wii only having two USB ports, a USB hub is shipped with certain retail sku's to add more USB ports. The game uses the standard logitech USB microphone for the Wii.",
