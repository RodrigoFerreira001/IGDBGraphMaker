When preparing to bowl a ball, the player can choose to throw the ball several seconds after their character has walked up to the line during their approach. The game comes with several characters that players can use and locations where players can bowl. There is also a guy called George with a long beard who you can play as only after bowling 3 perfect games. Characters include a Scottish person that wears a kilt who bowls with his plaid ball, and a Brazilian soccer player who bowls with a black and white ball. AMF Bowling World Lanes also contains several bowling mini-games.[2]",
