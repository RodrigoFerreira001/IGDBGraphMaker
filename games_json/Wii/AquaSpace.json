You can simply relax by watching the fish or take the opportunity to read detailed information about them, such as scientific name and habitat, using the illustrated encyclopedia. If you want to get up close and personal with the fish, you can even dive in with a Mii character to swim with them, feed them, or hunt for trivia icons to discover fish-related facts! \n \nChoose from eight aquarium themes and then spruce them up with around 40 different fish and a variety of decorations, wallpaper, and plant life. In addition, you can change the background music by taking your pick from a selection of songs or using the sound of water. Then once everything is set up, you can view your aquarium from a variety of camera angles (including a fish\u2019s eye view) to get a good look at and appreciate the fish. \n \nAlso make sure to visit every day and see your aquarium change\u2014your fish will grow and new fish may be born. Life continues in your aquariums even while the Wii console is turned off!",
