    "summary": "Busy Scissors is the first hair cutting and styling game of its kind for the Nintendo Wii and DS. Aspiring stylists of all ages, are you ready to train with Bizzy at the Busy Scissors salon? Put your best hair forward and see if you can make the cut! Are You Ready To Get Busy? Get ready to color, shampoo, cut, blow dry, and style hair with the Wii remote. Players earn reputation and advance their career in a Hollywood based salon by meeting the demands of their glamorous and eccentric clientele, from celebrities to high-end fashion designers and world famous rock stars! The game progresses as they help unlock each client's inner potential by finding their unique outward style. The game features over 30 hairstyles, 20 mini-games and 6 career levels, which provide a dynamic combination of realistic gameplay, humor, and entertainment. Manifest Oranj, the game's developer, spent months working with industry experts to emulate the real hair styles used in the game. Each salon technique was demonstrated and filmed by the team, before it was re-created in 3D and designed as a mini-game.",
