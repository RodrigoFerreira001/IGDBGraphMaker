        "synopsis": "This is a dancing simulation game in which players perform and learn dance steps by following the movements of on-screen avatars. The virtual dancers resemble silkscreen-negative silhouettes: they are stylized after the era of each song, and their outfits are not especially revealing. The dance moves, however, occasionally involve spanking, pelvic thrusting, hip shaking, and swaying hips. That accounts for the Mild Suggestive Themes descriptor. The game is rated E-10+ because it contains some songs with expletives (e.g., \"a*s\") and suggestive or crude content (e.g., \"You're a womanizer,\" \"She spent her twenties between the sheets,\" and a \"PMS\" insult)."
