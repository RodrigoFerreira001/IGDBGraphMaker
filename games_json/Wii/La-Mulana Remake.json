Players use shurikens, whips, spears, and bombs to defeat a variety of roaming animals and fantastical enemies (e.g., bats, snakes, mummies, gargoyles, skeletons); enemies disappear in swirls of orange light when defeated. During one boss fight, small drops of red liquid can be seen falling from the ceiling. A handful of female enemies are depicted in suggestive attire (e.g., a snake-like boss with exposed cleavage), and one male character can be dressed in a somewhat revealing Sexy Bathing Suit outfit."
