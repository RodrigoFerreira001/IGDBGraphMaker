        "synopsis": "Deadly Creatures is an action adventure game in which players can assume the roles of an armored scorpion and a tarantula spider as they move through desert terrain and underground passages. Players can inject creatures (e.g., Gila monsters, horned lizards, praying mantis, etc.) with poison, infest an area, cast deadly webs and destroy various rats, beetles, and snakes with their tails. Red blood is emitted from the reptiles or rats when attacked. There is a reference to alcohol in the dialogue (e.g., '\u2026he was a drunk.'), and mild profanity can be heard throughout the game (e.g., 'goddamn,' 'bastard,' and 'son of a b*tch')."

    "summary": "Deadly Creatures allows players to play as a young male desert hairy scorpion and an adult female tarantula and engage in brutal combat against other arachnids, insects, rats, and reptiles.\nThe two creatures have different playing styles, with the scorpion's levels featuring more action-oriented gameplay, while the tarantula is more stealth oriented, with less linear levels. The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used for both movement and attacks, with motion controls incorporated for special attacks and finishing moves, while the tarantula also utilizes the pointer function to shoot webs. New abilities are also gained as the player progresses through the game.\nAlong with dispatching common arthropods such as pill bugs, crickets, beetles, and wolf spiders, most of which can be devoured to regain health, the player also faces bosses including a Gila Monster, a rattlesnake and eventually a human. The clashes between the creatures are described as similar to monster movies, with a similar impact to battles in King Kong and Jurassic Park albeit on a smaller scale.",
