Players score points by accurately moving their bodies in time with the music and scrolling indicators. One song contains the word \u201chell\u201d'; other songs include mildly suggestive lyrics (e.g., \u201cKiss me here, touch me there, hanky-panky,\u201d \u201cI'll make you hot,\u201d and \u201cDon't like his baggy jeans, but I'ma like what's underneath them.\u201d).
