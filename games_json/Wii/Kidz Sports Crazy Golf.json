    "summary": "Now you can have this much crazy fun in your own home thanks to Data Design Interactive - a successful video games publisher and games developer, who today announced a new title to be added to their Nintendo Wii label, Popcorn Arcade, kidz Sports - Crazy Mini Golf. DDI have incorporated two game styles; for first timers it's a case of hitting the A bottom when you are lined up, then moving your arm up and down before hitting the B bottom - simple. If you fancy a real challenge, you could try the Sim version where the hitting of the ball and its strength is down to you - once mastered, you will feel like a putting green King... Play through 74 crazy holes set over 4 wacky courses in Crazy Mini Golf.",
