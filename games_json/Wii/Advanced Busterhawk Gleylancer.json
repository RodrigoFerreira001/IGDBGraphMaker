    "summary": "Advanced Busterhawk Gley Lancer, commonly known as Gleylancer (\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc), is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up by NCS released exclusively in Japan (despite having some of its text, such as in the Mover configuration screen described below, in near-perfect English). It was released internationally on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008. Despite the English configuration screen, translation group M.I.J.E.T. released a patch which translated the story text in 2006-2007. \n \nLucia is the 16-year-old daughter of a fighter pilot who disappears while fighting a war between humans and aliens in 2025. He was captured by aliens whom he had captured earlier who had the ability to teleport. Lucia hijacks the prototype fighter CSH-01-XA \"Gley Lancer\" to save him.",
