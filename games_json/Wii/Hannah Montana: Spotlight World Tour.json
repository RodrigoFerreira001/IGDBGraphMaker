    "summary": "In story mode you will play through the story of the movie which takes you from the stages of Los Angeles to your home town of Crowley Corners. You also have to help Travis build a chicken house and find missing items. In between you have concerts where you will do dance moves, play keyboard, drums, guitar and sing with a microphone. The performance part is done by pressing keys or buttons in the correct order. Before starting the story mode you will have to complete a short tutorial where you will learn all the moves and the instruments. Completing tasks will give you tokens which you can use to buy more clothes, furnitures or items to your tour bus.",
