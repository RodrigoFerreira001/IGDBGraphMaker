Fire lasers and blue pellets at a steady wave of fruit and vegetable creatures, causing the personified food to explode in a bright burst. The depiction is mostly whimsical, though you do see their \"kill percentage\" tallied on menu screens at the end of each round. Game customized for each target platform.",
