        "synopsis": "Players use swords, axes and hammers to attack fantasy creatures in this action role-playing game. Combat usually involves \"melee-style\" attacks where characters' axe swipes and sword strikes occur at close-range, are frenetic, and are met with cries of pain. Players can also command several \"tag-along\" gremlin-like minions to attack enemies (e.g., half-lings, gingerbread doughboys, and fairies), break objects, and open pathways that allow the Overlord to progress. During the course of the game, players can vigorously shake their minions, which causes them to explode in a burst of light. One side-quest mission involves delivering a drunk man home to his angry wife."

    "summary": "Overlord: Dark Legend is a 2009 action role-playing game developed by Climax Studios and published by Codemasters for the Wii. The game was released on 23 June 2009 in North America, 26 June in Europe, and 2 July in Australia.[1][2] \n \nDark Legend is a spinoff of the 2007 video game Overlord, and is set as a prequel. The gameplay is similar to Overlord, but presents some differences. While the game does not have several features of the original game or its sequel, Overlord II, it offers some new content and a new gameplay style taking advantage of the Wii controller. \n \nReviews of the game are mixed: praising the humour, story, and controls of the game, but finding problems with the animation, short game length, and lack of complexity or difficulty.",
