    "summary": "Mountain Sports includes a variety of thrilling high-impact outdoor activities: skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing/tubing, bobsledding, curling and the biathlon. All of the sports except curling give players the option to hop on the Wii Balance Board for intuitive fun, carving up the slopes as they strive to become the Winter Sports Festival champion. Sit on the board to navigate the slippery bobsled course, or turn the board sideways and go for big air on the slopestyle snowboarding event! Players can also choose to use the Wii Remote to outmaneuver and blast past the competition, using full-body motion. The game is both intuitive and fun, and with four-player support, everyone can get in on the frosty action.",
