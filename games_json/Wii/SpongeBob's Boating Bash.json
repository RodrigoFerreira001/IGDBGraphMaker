SpongeBob's Boating Bash draws upon one of the most popular events in the TV series - SpongeBob's tireless tenacity to earn his boating license. After failing the boating exam 78 times, a shady shark character tricks SpongeBob into taking the zany D.R.I.V.E. course that will send him and his friends steering out of control. In this fast-paced, demolition derby style party game, players will drive around in boat mobiles and compete in wacky arenas throughout Bikini Bottom to be the last boat standing.",
