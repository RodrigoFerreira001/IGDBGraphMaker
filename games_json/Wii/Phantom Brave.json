        "synopsis": "This is a fantasy role-playing game (RPG) in which players follow the story of a young girl and her friends as they explore a fantasy world and investigate the sudden disappearance of the population. Players fight various creatures, such as slime monsters and phantoms, in turn-based combat using magical spells or hand-to-hand combat. Some cutscenes depict still images of characters covered in streaks of blood or lying in pools of blood. In one sequence, an old man impales himself with a large sword as spurts of blood shoot from his body. During the course of the game, characters make suggestive comments, including references to breast size (e.g., \"It's not my fault you're so flat-chested\" and \"Her boobs are bigger than mine\") and jokes about liking younger females. In one cutscene, two characters share a purple-colored drink at a restaurant; it is strongly implied that they are drinking alcohol (e.g., slurred speech; \"Don't drink so much. It will make your condition worse.\"). Some expletives (e.g., \"bastard,\" \"a*s,\" and \"hell\") can be heard in the dialogue."

    "summary": "Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities. \n \nThe game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.",
