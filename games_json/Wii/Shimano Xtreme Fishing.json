    "summary": "Adventurous anglers can treat their Wii Remote and Nunchuk as more than a simple rod and reel in Shimano Xtreme Fishing, a game that also lets players go bowfishing or head underwater for SCUBA-clad spearfishing. Gamers can choose from an array of real-world gear, such as Shimano fishing rods, Hoyt bows, and Muzzy arrow points, as they fish above and below water in unique locations spread throughout the world. As players plumb the depths they will encounter more than 40 different types of fish, but danger also lurks around the best fishing hotspots in the form of sharks and alligators. Tournaments serve as Shimano Xtreme Fishing's primary game mode, each offering unique scenery, time restrictions, and weather effects, but those simply looking to practice their skills or spend a leisurely day on the water can also roam each environment in \"Free Fish\" mode.",
