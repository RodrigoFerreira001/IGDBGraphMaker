The colony supercomputer has been infected with a virus, and now the planet's giant machines are turning against the people who created them. You must pilot your bipedal attack machine through 12 missions to reboot the computer. \n \nThe graphics in this game use scaled and rotated sprites to achieve a 3D environment. The effect is similar to other Core Design games for the Sega CD.",
