    "summary": "Third World War is a \"hypothetical/what if\" wargame with a twist. Set sometime in the late 20th century, when conflicts all over the world have erupted, and world peace is but a thing of the past. \n \nAs the leader of one of 16 nations, your ultimate goal is none other than world domination. To accomplish this you have a multitude of options ranging from raw military might, diplomacy, foreign or domestic investment policy, aiding terrorists or revolutionaries, to media manipulation. In other words, it's just like the real world.",
