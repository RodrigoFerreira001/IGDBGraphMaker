Both floppy disk-based and ROM board-based versions of the game exist. The game presents itself in a pseudo-3D setting a la T&E Soft golf games like Pebble Beach Golf Links where the screen slowly redraws itself at certain intervals in your swing. \n \nA game with the same name for the Sega Mega-CD was produced, but only released in Japan. Whether or not this is the same game is unknown.",
