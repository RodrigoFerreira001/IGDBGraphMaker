    "summary": "Hellnight (Dark Messiah in Japan) is a first-person survival horror game released in 1998, in Japan and Europe only, for the PlayStation. The game takes place underground at the end of the millennium, in a mess of sewers and subways which the player must navigate and escape by solving puzzles. There is no combat in the game, and only one type of enemy - relentless mutant creatures - which must be avoided at all costs, usually by running away. The player can have companions along the way, but any contact with the mutants will result in their permanent deaths. \n\nThe game failed to generate much recognition at the time of release, but has since developed a cult following.",
