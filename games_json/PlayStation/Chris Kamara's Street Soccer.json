The teams are cities from different countries, such as London, England and Paris, France. The game incorrectly lists Prague as from Norway rather than Czech Republic. Some of the teams consist of female players. \n \nThe game can be played in either Exhibition, Arcade, Time Attack, League, Cup and Penalty Shootout mode. The game allows up to 8 players to play via multi-tap.",
