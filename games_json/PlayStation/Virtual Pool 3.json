Featuring a new single player mode and online gaming capabilities to accommodate multiplayer action over a LAN or a modem, Virtual Pool 3 Featuring Jeanette Lee continues the tradition that made previous installments a commercial success. \n \nThe game offers numerous game modes from which to choose, including a career mode that allows you to begin as a local player and move up through six stages on the proverbial success ladder. You can also play head-to-head against Jeanette Lee (aka \"Black Widow\"), adjust camera angles, set up shots, play in a tournament with 4, 8, 16 or 32 players and choose from 9-ball, 8-ball, straight pool and several other game configurations.",
