    "summary": "A digital re-creation of the hobby of puzzle building, Jigsaw Madness offers gamers a collection of 150 different puzzles (across a variety of themes) that can be pieced together, alone or against up to three other players. Utilizing a small hand-shaped cursor, players construct puzzles that range in size from 24 to 96 to 150 pieces, each depicting anything from animals and insects to sports and anim\u00e9 characters. Players are given only seven pieces at a time with which to work, and basic statistics such as the number of pieces placed both, correctly and incorrectly, as well as the time elapsed is continually displayed. \n \nThe multiplayer portion of the title allows up to four players to compete against one another, in a race to see who can complete the puzzle fastest. A handful of options are available, including whether or not an outline of the various shapes is displayed on the playing field, thereby making the game easier.",
