The six main modes include championship, split-screen head-to-head, single races and time attack modes. There are 12 tracks available and these have been divided into motocross, supercross and endure tracks, both indoor and outdoor, with different surfaces. On top of that, each course can also be reversed. An additional touch is added by dynamic weather effects. \n \nEach bike, with different performances, can be fully tuned based on suspension, brakes, gears, tires...
