Economic controls are also available, including taxes and troop unrest.",

It was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a number of other platforms, including a re-release in 1996 on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. It was well-received at its inception, and was considered to be a significant step forward in the complexity of strategy gaming.",
