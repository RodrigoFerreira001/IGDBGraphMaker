    "summary": "Angelique Special is a renovated version of Koei's first Angelique game, Angelique Special featured several new animated scenes, in addition to voice acting by several big-name voice actors. This version appeared on PC-FX, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation, plus a hard-to-find PC version. Among the new animated scenes were several love events that were not present in the original game. Others included the opening sequence and the endings. \n \nThis is also the first (and currently only) title in the Angelique series to have an official translation: a Chinese language version exists for PC.",
