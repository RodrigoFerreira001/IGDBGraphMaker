    "summary": "MLB PENNANT RACE offers players a choice between an Arcade mode that allows players to throw pitches unhindered by the laws of physics, or Sim mode where everything is more realistic. Fans of old-school baseball games like RBI BASEBALL or other arcade titles will feel right at home with the quick and exciting control of the arcade version. In both modes there are a wealth of stats for gamers to peruse and study, and the obligatory Playoff and World Series mode as well as Quick Play, Season and Home Run Derby can also be found. Or you can take on a friend in the Versus mode and find out who is going to take the pennant home.",
