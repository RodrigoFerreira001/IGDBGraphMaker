It is the sequel to Kurushi. \n \nStanding on an isolated platform, you must destroy blocks that are rolling towards you in order to survive. By destroying certain blocks, the size of the platform increases. If blocks fall off the edge of the platform, or you destroy the incorrect blocks, the platform becomes smaller. \n \nThere are four game modes: 100 Attack, Survival, Create and Final. It has nine player characters (1 Initial, 8 Hidden) and includes a facility to create custom levels.",
