    "summary": "Metal Gear Solid: Integral is an expanded version of the original Metal Gear Solid first released for the PlayStation in the NTSC-J region in 1999 and later released for Windows in other regions in 2000. It includes most of the changes and additions that were made in the NTSC-U/C version of the original Metal Gear Solid (e.g. adjustable difficulty settings, English voice acting, and Solid Snake's hidden tuxedo outfit), as well as new features and changes of its own, including a third disc consisting almost entirely of VR training missions dubbed the \"VR Disc.\" The VR Disc was released by itself for the PlayStation in overseas territories as Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions in the NTSC-U/C region and as Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions in the PAL region.",
