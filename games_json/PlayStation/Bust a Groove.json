    "summary": "Bust a Groove is a hybrid music/fighting game for the Sony PlayStation released in 1998. The game was published by the Japanese video game developer Enix (now Square Enix) in Japan and brought to the U.S. by now-defunct 989 Studios.\n\nThe original Japanese game was titled Bust a Move: Dance & Rhythm Action (\u30d0\u30b9\u30c8 \u30a2 \u30e0\u30fc\u30d6 Dance & Rhythm Action Basuto a M\u016bbu Dance & Rhythm Action); in the U.S., it became Bust-A-Groove because the Japanese puzzle series Puzzle Bobble was already going under the name Bust-A-Move for its American incarnation. The game combined PaRappa the Rapper-like rhythm-based gameplay with fighting game elements, including special moves designed to damage the opponent and a focus on head-to-head competitive play.\n\nThe sequel, Bust a Groove 2, unlike its predecessor, was never released in Europe. A third game in the series, Dance Summit 2001 was only released in Japan on the PlayStation 2.",
