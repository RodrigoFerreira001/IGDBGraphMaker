Your only mission is to rid the land of the same vile evil that had annihilated your family. Now is the time to be a Hero! Now is the time to fight with fury! Now is the time for you to forge your victories!\n\nLive by the sword and you'll die by the sword. Live by stealth, quick, reflex, and an insatiable thirst for revenge and you might just get away with your life. Are you brave enough?",
