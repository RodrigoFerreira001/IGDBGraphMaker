It was released on 20 April 2001 in Europe, 24 September in North America and 11 October in Japan. It was the first game to support the Logitech racing wheel (a.k.a. GT Force) (PS2 only). \n \nFormula One 2001 was the last simulation Formula One game to appear on the PSone (as the PlayStation had become known by that point, to differentiate it from the PlayStation 2). It was also the last game in the series released in North America before the 2005 release of F1 Grand Prix for the PlayStation Portable.",
