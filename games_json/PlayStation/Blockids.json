    "summary": "Blockids for PlayStation is a 3D take on the arcade classic Breakout. Players choose one of eight animated characters and prepare to compete against an assortment of colorful opponents whose fortresses must be breached. The object is to break a series of bricks by smashing a ricocheting ball into them using a horizontal paddle. \n \nThe default view is presented from an angled top-down perspective, but players can switch to a perspective right behind the paddle for a more 3D feel. New twists on the classic gameplay include the ability to bounce the ball over barriers as well as earn a special power-up by scoring a certain number of points.",
