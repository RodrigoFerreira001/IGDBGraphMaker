    "summary": "Ever wanted to be a beach ball? References to Baywatch aside, this game is the most fun you'll ever have on a beach. Kula World puts you in the role of an inflatable beach ball, trapped in a never ending series of three-dimensional puzzles floating above the ancient Pyramids. \n \nYou'll get to bounce your rubberized alter ego to your heart's content in this game. As puzzles go, it's as irritating and frustrating as any other, but the special attraction of Kula World is its ability to totally spatially disorient you with its stomach-turning, rotating levels and power-ups that make everything go wobbly for a few seconds. \n \nThere are also the following three \"helpful\" objects that will either add to your score or activate bonus levels: fruits, coins and gems. Two one-player modes include the regular \"Arcade\" game and \"Time Trial,\" which has you trying to complete each level within one minute.",
