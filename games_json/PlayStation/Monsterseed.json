    "summary": "Monster Seed obviously takes influence from the popular animal raising/fighting genre; specifically games like Pok\u00e9mon and Monster Rancher. Of course, it does do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games. \n \nSimilar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.",
