Here the player must race on up to seven different circuits, in a range of modes, similar to its predecessor. The modes are Wrecking Racing (where the player must destroy or spin the other competitors), Stock Car (a typical race where it's 1st to the flag) and Destruction Derby, which is based around the crash arenas. Commentator Paul Page performed as the announcer. This Racing game is widely known for its destruction and chaotic themes that follow by loud, gritty and dark metal songs.",
