    "summary": "The setting takes place in the Japan-inspired Kingdom of Japone, where, around 450 years before the story starts, the Demon King Dragless rampaged through the lands until a young hero defeated and sealed him away. After centuries of slumber, Dragless is now showing signs of awakening, and it's now up to the 14-years old Daigo Raioh, descendant of the young hero, to defeat the monster once and for all. Meanwhile, other talented fighters will set out, some for reasons related to Dragless (like Terrific Forelock, the bodyguard and childhood friend of Princess Mirona, who's out to save her after she has been kidnapped by the Demon King), others not at all (like Misa Atago, who goes on a trip to ease the pain of her break-up with her boyfriend). In the end, all of them will learn about Dragless and realize how serious the situation is.",
