    "summary": "In Superstar Dance Club, players control 18-year old Suzy as she strives to become the Super Star Dance Club Champion of Tokyo by perfecting her rhythmic dance skills during 21 stages at various clubs. By earning a high passing grade in each stage, new stages are unlocked and Suzy earns money (chips) that determine which of the multiple endings are achieved at the end of the game. \n \nThree difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, and expert) offer a chance for beginning players to build up the necessary coordination skills to match the correct button press (Circle, Square, X, or Triangle) with the onscreen prompt in time to the music. Bonus money can be earned by using the left and right triggers to add special sound effects during the dances.",
