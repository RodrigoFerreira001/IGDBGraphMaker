    "summary": "In Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes it Out, it will take a player's racing prowess and lead foot to make it through the pitfalls and troubles of this dusty country county. Players will control either the Duke boys in their high-powered General Lee or Daisy in her jeep as they sweep through the dirt roads and downtown of Hazzard. Levels alternate between the two vehicles, and the objectives you must complete are varied as well. You might find yourself outrunning the law or perhaps showing someone the sights in Hazzard. You might even deliver some mail, but eventually you'll get down to some good, old-fashioned crime fighting.",
