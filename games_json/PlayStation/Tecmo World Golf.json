    "summary": "Tecmo World Golf distinguishes itself from all previous console golf games by offering 101 (yes, that's 1-0-1) authentic Japanese courses to play on. Choose from four male or four female players, each differing in power and shot tendency, or customize your own character. \n \nYou'll be able to edit the golfer's name, appearance, handicap (from one to forty) and shot tendency, which determines the ball's trajectory after contact is made. You can also adjust each club's maximum shot distance and the golfer's starting tee position to improve your performance out on the links.",
