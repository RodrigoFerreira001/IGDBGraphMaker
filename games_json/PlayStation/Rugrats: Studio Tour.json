    "summary": "Help the Rugrats prove that they're more than a bunch of babies as you track down Tommy's little brother Dil in a Hollywood movie studio. Play as Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, and Angelica as you search every nook and cranny of the four major sets: \"Diapies of Thunder,\" \"Captain Cookies,\" \"Lazy Saddles,\" and \"Outside Space\" each with its own expansive levels. Enter the Dressing Room to determine which set you'll start from, then choose the order you want to play the levels. There are 16 scenarios in all, including Pirate Mini-Golf, Buried Treasure, Western Roundup, and Loonie Lander. Once you complete all of the regular stages, you'll enter the Find Dil stages. Collect coins, cookies, chocolate milk, keys, aliens, beach balls, and more as you trek through difficult circumstances to rescue one of your own. Up to four players can get in on the action in Multiplayer mode, as well. Good luck, babies!",
