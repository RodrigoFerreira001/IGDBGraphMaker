False strikes, swerves, return attacks, and short-strike lunges will keep you on the edge. Even if you do land a strike, watch these fish go for obstacles in order ot break your line! Multiple difficulty levels, plenty of tricks in your lure box, multiple game modes, multiple lakes, and more. Sit in a boat and go for the fish, or simulate a whole fishing trip. The choice is yours!",
