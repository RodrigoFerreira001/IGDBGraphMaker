    "summary": "Newman/Haas presents racing in its purest form - no power-ups, shortcuts, or weapons here - and playing it requires equal parts patience, skill, and raw endurance. Those looking for an authentic Indy Car experience are in luck, as this is a game of remarkable depth and customizability. It offers a mind-boggling array of options - digital or analog control, single- or dual-player racing, four levels of difficulty, eleven tracks, 16 drivers, and a partridge in the pit stop. OK, I'm kidding about the last item, but it's obvious that Psygnosis doesn't think Indy Car racing is a laughing matter, and it's gone to great lengths to make Newman/Haas as realistic as possible.",
