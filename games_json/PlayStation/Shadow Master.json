    "storyline": "For over a millennium, two alien races had been waging an interstellar war, known as the Outer War. Now, during the fictional year of 1742, the people of the planet Sylvan began to grow uneasy as rumors had spread involving the disappearances of trade ships. Eventually the planet had lost contact with many of its outlying trade ships and star ports, which led to the complete communications blackout of the systems outer worlds. Refugees had come from the outer planets and told stories of mass destruction, death and plunder, with entire worlds being stripped of their resources, and countless innocence were either enslaved or slaughtered by mechanoid monsters. A 'death black-shadow' as was referred to by the elders of Sylvan, had engulfed the system. An invasion fleet has begun to occupy the planet, with one force standing in the way of its complete take over: you.",
