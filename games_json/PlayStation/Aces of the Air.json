    "summary": "Fans of classic aircraft take to the skies in Aces of the Air for the PlayStation. Pilot the vintage fliers in realistic 3D combat missions featuring old-school dogfighting techniques and ground combat. Each successfully completed mission earns players a new plane, all created with their own strengths and weaknesses. Those a bit nervous about the first flight will be happy to know a training mode teaches new fliers the basics of vintage aircraft control. \n \nAces of the Air features realistic, 3-D flight simulation, with a focus on dogfighting techniques using vintage aircraft. Missions include aerial combat, strafing ground troops and materiel, and taking out heavily fortified enemy positions.",
