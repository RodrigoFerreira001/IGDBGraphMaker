You oblige and while in the mine there is an explosion which causes you fall to the lower levels. In the mine you find a treasure chest with a bamboo staff in, which becomes your weapon for the rest of the game. After much wandering you find your way out and meet Master Sage, who gives you a headband which he can use to communicate with you. He then sends you to the library to stop the Nightmare King from stealing the Magic Storybook.",
