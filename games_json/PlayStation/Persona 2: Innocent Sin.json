        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of high-school students who must investigate mysterious events in a fictional modern-day metropolis. From a 3/4\u2013overhead perspective, players explore urban environments and use guns, swords, and magic spells to battle demons and human characters in turn-based combat (e.g., selecting attacks/weapons from a menu screen); enemies blink and disappear when defeated. Some cutscenes contain still-frame portraits of characters with blood dripping down their faces. One sequence depicts a group of characters locking a girl inside a building before setting it on fire (e.g., \u201cTo make sure she can't go anywhere . . . we're gonna kill Big Sis, right?\u201d). During the course of the game, there are some suggestive/sexual references in the dialogue and creature descriptions (e.g., \u201cDid you already score with one of them at school!?\u201d \u201cAnd those bouncing jugs of hers,\u201d \u201cA demoness who drains men of their energy through sex,\u201d and \u201cComputers! What're they used for?\u201d/\u201cFor porn.\u201d). While exploring the city, players can enter a casino and use virtual credits to play rounds of video poker, blackjack, and slots. The dialogue contains the words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cd*ck,\u201d as well as a couple of drug references (e.g., \u201cAnd experimenting with those nassssty drugs?\u201d and \u201cAre you a druggie? Me too . . .\u201d)."

The original version was not localized for western territories, but the PSP version was released in North America and Europe under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin takes place in the fictional Sumaru City, focusing on a group of high school students from Seven Sisters High School. The main protagonist, Tatsuya Suou, and a group of friends must confront a villainous figure called the Joker, who is causing the spread of reality-warping rumors through the city. The group are aided in their quest by their Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.",
