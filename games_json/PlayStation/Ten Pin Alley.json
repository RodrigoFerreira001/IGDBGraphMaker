    "summary": "Ten Pin Alley is a ten-pin bowling simulation game released by ASC Games in 1996 and developed internally at Adrenalin Entertainment. \n \nThe game was released on November 30, 1996 in North America, and eventually released in February 1998 in the United Kingdom. Just before its North American release, Sony selected the game's demo to be included on its PS1 sampler disc. \n \nA sequel to the game entitled Ten Pin Alley 2, developed by an unknown developer, was mooted for a release on the PlayStation 2, but for unknown reasons was shelved. Despite this, the sequel, developed by Pronto Games and published by XS Games was released on the Game Boy Advance to dismal reviews. \n \nTen Pin Alley should not be confused with an audio game with the same title made by PCS Games",
