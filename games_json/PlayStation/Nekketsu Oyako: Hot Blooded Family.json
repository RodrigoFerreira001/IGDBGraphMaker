But when a band of no-good bad guys calling themselves the Haraguro-dan find out, they figure she's perfect to help them complete their ultimate secret doomsday weapon and kidnap her. Her family aren't going to take this lying down, though, and immediately take up arms, setting out to free her by whatever means necessary!",
