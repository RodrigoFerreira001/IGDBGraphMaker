Journey to distant lands in the search of the Goddess Althena, who may be the only one powerful enough to stop Zophar. Along to way, you'll meet exciting new caracters, fight vividly animated monsters, traverse snow-covered mountain peaks, and crawl throught slimy dungeon depths as you wind your way toword the terrifying climax! LUNAR 2 features almost an hour of detailed animation sequences and over 90 minutes of dialogue packed onto three CDs... so what are you waiting for? Go ahead, you deserve to be the hero for once!",
