        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players assume the role of high school students that battle demons in their hometown. Players traverse through dungeons, negotiate with enemies, and enter turn-based battles with an assortment of demons, zombies, spirits, and slimes. Players can use conventional weapons (e.g., swords, spears, and firearms) or summon demons called 'Personas' to perform magic spells against enemies. There are a number of demons/characters in the game that appear sexually suggestive: A silver-skinned demon's breasts are exposed; a phallic-shaped demon bursts out of a character's stomach; butterfly and spider creatures briefly expose portions of their buttocks. In one sequence, a character attempts to seduce another person by saying, 'Oooh, my chest is sore . . . Maybe if you gave it a little rub . . .' During the course of the game, players can enter a casino and wager virtual money on games of video Blackjack, slots, and poker. Profanity (e.g., 'sh*t,' 'a*shole,' and 'd*ckweed') occasionally appears in the dialogue."

Using this power under the guidance of Philemon, a benevolent being representing humanity's subconscious, the group face off against multiple forces that threaten the world. Gameplay revolves around the characters navigating environments around their town and fighting enemies using their Personas. During the course of the game, the player can create new Personae for battle using spell cards gained in battle or by talking with enemies.",
