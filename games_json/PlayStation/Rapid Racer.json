    "summary": "From the same team that developed Porsche Challenge for the PlayStation, this is a high-speed racer where the user controls a number of adrenaline-pumping speedboats. \n \nChoose from a selection of teams and powerboats, with lightning fast gameplay and true handling dynamics, so be careful how you accelerate and turn - these things aren't as stable as cars. \n \nThe game has a number of different game modes, (including championships - battling against 20 other competitors), bonus games, and multiplayer modes.",
