    "summary": "NBA IN THE ZONE \u00bf98 is a traditional five-on-five basketball game that follows the lead of its predecessors, NBA IN THE ZONE and NBA IN THE ZONE 2. In the original game, the emphasis was on an arcade look and feel. NBA IN THE ZONE '98 advances the series' evolution by leaning towards more of a basketball simulation. New options include an on-the-fly play-calling system as well as statistical tracking, which not only keeps season stats but also charts league leaders in various categories. You can also take on a friend in Versus mode and see who is really in the zone; with two multitaps, up to eight people can play at one time.",
