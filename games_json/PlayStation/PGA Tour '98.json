    "summary": "Go on the links with EA Sports' PGA TOUR '98. The game features five championship courses: the exclusively licensed Pebble Beach Golf Links, The Bay Hill Club, TPC of Scottsdale, Colonial Country Club, and TPC at Sawgrass. Each course has been designed using actual blueprints of the real courses, resulting in amazingly realistic graphics. Every hole features the real characteristics and surroundings of the real thing, including trees on the fairways, sloping hills, huge bunkers, and tricky greens. Compete as or against 14 PGA Tour pros, including Mark O'Meara, Lee Janzen, Davis Love III, and Brad Faxon. All 14 pros' swings and unique post-shot reactions were digitized into the game to give you the most realistic golf experience imaginable.",
