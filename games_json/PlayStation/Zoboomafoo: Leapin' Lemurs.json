Aside from the interactive action this game offers, it also focuses on helping players learn about the animals they encounter. When you meet a new animal, the game will give you \"Animal Fun Facts\" that tell you something about the way that animal lives. So get ready to take on the role of Zoboomafoo, where you'll scamper, scurry, and more importantly, learn!",
