    "summary": "Builder's Block is a puzzle game in which you must construct buildings and then eliminate them for points. Although a certain color can only eliminate itself, the object of this game is to match colored blocks together to form buildings. Once you have made a building, you can eliminate it by shooting a block on the corner of it. The larger the building, the more benefits you'll reap when you destroy it! \n \nThe game can be played three different ways: Puzzle mode, Battle mode, and Arcade mode. In the Puzzle mode, you must travel to one of seven different courses and construct specific size buildings. You must not destroy the buildings in this mode. The object is to build cities for the specific course or region you're in and make the cities grow.",
