    "summary": "Tour the world and ride open and interactive terrain through 12 levels of real-world skate spots from your hometown to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and international hotspots in the UK and Germany. The open-nature of the courses allow for constant mixing up of tricks on the quest to find the perfect line. \n \nChoose from six different fictional skaters with varying degrees of strength and weakness. For a tough and versatile skater, choose Axl or for a more balanced skater take Kahli on your mission. Each skater features their own skating and clothing style. \n \nAlthough each skater offers a different and varying skill level, their mission objectives are the same. Each player starts off as a wanna-be amateur skater with no sponsor or street credibility. Your goal is to turn your skater into the Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year.",
