He can also climb up on certain surfaces, and swim underwater. \n \nThe game takes place in a large hub filled with several TV screens based on various genres, parodying various genres from Looney Tunes to Star Wars. Each level has about three remotes to collect, as well as an additional one for collecting 120 collectibles within the level. Collecting enough remotes unlock new areas, bonus levels and boss levels and collecting all remotes unlocks a special ending showing concept art for the game.",
