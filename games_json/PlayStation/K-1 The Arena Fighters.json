    "summary": "All of the punches, kicks, knockouts, and general brutality of kickboxing have come to the PlayStation with K-1 THE ARENA FIGHTERS. You can choose from eight fighters based on real-world kickboxers, and then experience the brutal nature of the sport in a Single-Player match, or try to become champion in a Tournament. If you're looking for a different kind of challenge, pick a team of boxers, and beat up the opposition in the Team Challenge mode. If your friends challenge your dominance of the ring, put them in their place with a match in the Versus mode. No matter what mode you play, motion-captured animation makes all the characters move realistically. If you are good enough, you can unlock a video that shows how the motion-capture work was done. Do you have the stamina to become the best of the best in K-1 THE ARENA FIGHTERS?",
