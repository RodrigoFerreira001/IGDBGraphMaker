    "summary": "Ganbare Goemon: \u014cedo Daikaiten is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the PlayStation on March 29, 2001. \n \nA villain named Ecorori kidnaps Omitsu, and it's up to Goemon and his crew to stop him. \n \nThe game is extremely similar to Ganbare Goemon 2 for Super Famicom and Goemon's Great Adventure/Mystical Ninja 2 in that there's mostly sidescrolling levels, accompanied by some Impact bosses. Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku.",
