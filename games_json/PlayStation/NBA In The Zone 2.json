    "summary": "Get ready to run the floors with NBA In the Zone 2 from Konami. After last years title, Konami has stepped up and added new features to ITZ2 to make it the best possible basketball game. Featuring different play modes such as exhibition and full season play, as well as containing full rosters for all the NBA teams and the ability to make substitutions, ITZ2 is loaded. \n \nAlso beefed up is the AI. Not only will it be harder to drive to the basket, gamers have a greater chance of getting fouled-out, with increased foul elements such as offensive fouls and basket-count. So step on the court and get ready for some solid b-ball action.",
