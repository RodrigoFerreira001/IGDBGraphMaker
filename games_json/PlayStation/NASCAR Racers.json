    "summary": "Based on the Fox cartoon series of the same name, NASCAR RACERS is a glimpse of what NASCAR will be like in the future. You can choose from five different cars, each with its own abilities that increase during the course of the race including one car that becomes invincible and another that gains a huge burst of speed. After you choose the correct car for your driving style, hit one of the 20 tracks available in the game. While you're on the track, you need to keep an eye out for the oil slicks, water puddles, and random debris that will slow down or damage your car. If the car sustains too much damage, then the race is over, for you anyway. Luckily, there is a truck to refuel and repair your vehicle. Will you be able to cross the finish line in NASCAR RACERS?",
