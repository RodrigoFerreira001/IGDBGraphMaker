    "summary": "In the year 2100, the bloodsport of choice is Speedball, a game that has only one hard-and-fast rule: slam a solid chromium ball into your opponent's goal. Managing Brutal Deluxe, the laughing stock of the World Speedball League, you've got nothing to lose. If winning is less about sportsmanship and more about playing dirty, using power-ups, and hospitalizing your opponents, then you've got to be a brute and a casual killer to succeed.\n\nThis 32-bit update to the original Speedball is best described as a futuristic combination of hockey and rollerball. Speedball 2100 pits two teams of nine players in a cage-like arena where they attempt to score by sending a steel ball past the goalie and into the small goal box. You can bounce the ball off the walls, and you can send opponents flying to the floor with a friendly shoulder charge. Fans of the predecessor will appreciate this sequel.",
