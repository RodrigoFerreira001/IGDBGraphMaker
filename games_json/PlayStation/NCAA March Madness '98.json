This game has all the pomp and circumstance of college basketball, complete with all the schools' fight songs. Run plays designed by Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski and manage your team over the long haul in Dynasty mode, or just jump straight to the Tournament and see if you can lead your team to the title. In the Dynasty mode you can try to recruit blue chip prospects or entice junior college transfers to come to your school. Of course, there is also a Versus mode so you can take on your friend and see who is the master of the hardwood. You can also team up with a friend and take on one of the legendary teams in a match-up for the ages.",
