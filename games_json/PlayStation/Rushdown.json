Kayaks, snowboards, and bikes are all individually rated in speed, handling, and grip, so you'll be able to select a model that suits your playing style before racing. Proud of the way you thrashed the opposition? Records for each course are saved to memory card along with names. Rushdown also features Dual Shock Analog Controller support, instant replays, 13 music tracks from six French bands, and an option to play a friend on either a horizontally or vertically split screen.",
