    "summary": "MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY: Winners Circle lets you live out your equestrian fantasies on your PlayStation. Before heading to competition, choose a horse and customize the color and breed. Once you have your mount, you must take care of it with feedings and grooming. When you're ready you can compete in dressage, jumping, and cross-country riding. Good performances will earn ribbons that can be traded for new outfits or other items to help you take care of your horse. All of the action takes place in either Career mode or Adventure mode. If you have friends who like ponies, they can join you in the action with the Two-Player option. So find your riding crop, put on your funny-looking hat, and get ready to ride with MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY: Winners Circle.",
