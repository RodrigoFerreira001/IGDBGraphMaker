    "summary": "Named for the year of its arcade release rather than the year of its arrival on the PlayStation, KING OF FIGHTERS '99 is classic 2D fighting for gamers of all walks. Choose a squad of three brave brawlers, and then get set to challenge teams of fighters from around the globe. The KING OF FIGHTERS series has been around the block a few times, boating classic titles on virtually every console and several arcade originals. It's popularity coming from fast-paced battle and intense scenarios; the series finds itself at its very best in this installment. Voice and picture galleries provide a history lesson for newcomers and sweet nostalgia for longtime fans, while a Color Edit system allows players to change the appearance of the combatants to their liking. This is pure, arcade-style combat for the die-hard gamers and old-school enthusiasts. Play alone or challenge a friend.",
