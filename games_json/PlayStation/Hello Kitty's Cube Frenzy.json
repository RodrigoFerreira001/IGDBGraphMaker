    "summary": "Hello Kitty comes to the Game Boy Color with HELLO KITTY'S CUBE FRENZY. The objective of each stage is simple: Kitty must collect all of the items scattered throughout each level. However, you can only tell Kitty to move left or right, and if you are not careful, Kitty will fall off the edge and say hello to the grim reaper. Luckily, blocks fall from the sky, which can be rotated and used to create staircases and bridges to the objects. However, placing three blocks with identical colors next to each other will make them disappear; this can both help and hurt. In addition to the block problems, Badz Maru, Hanamaru, and Pandaba will wander around and cause problems for Hello Kitty. Can you handle the pressure and collect all of the items in HELLO KITTY'S CUBE FRENZY?",
