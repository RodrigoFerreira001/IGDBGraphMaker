It is an updated version of the Dune II. In this game the player would have to fight for an interesting thing; the control of the spices in the galaxy. The spices control could make you the most powerful there. The player has to choose to be one of the three houses first: Atreides, Harkonnen, or Ordos. \n \nEach house has its own vice and virtue and the right selection could give the player right start to the game but he could learn as well as, later in the game with time. Once you choose a side, you to win the King\u2019s challenge of producing the most amount of spice. It won\u2019t be as easy as it sounds. For getting the control of the spices, the player has to fight over the other two houses by all means. \n \nDune 2000 is done with enough of stunt and live-in scenes to pep up the theme and there is a soothing sound score to add to the overall theme. It\u2019s a game based on the Dune series book of Frank Herbert and gives the player a real pleasure of both combat and competition.",
