Players can also practice their pitching and putting techniques or work on their long game by having a whack at the driving range. A traditional triple click interface is used to execute each shot, and two commentators will call the action as you progress through the links: choose legendary announcer Peter Allis, Fox Sports Net's John Walls, or have both analyzing your game.",
