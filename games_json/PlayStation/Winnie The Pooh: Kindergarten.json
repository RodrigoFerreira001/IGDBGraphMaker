    "summary": "It's time for kindergarten with Pooh! After watching Christopher Robin head off for a day at school, Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and friends decide they want to go to school, too. Kids can join Pooh and friends in a wonderful learning adventure as they all come together to hold school in the 100 Acre Wood. \n \nBAM! Entertainment takes the magic of learning to the PlayStation gaming console. Learning is made fun with engaging content surrounding the alphabet, simple arithmetic, problem solving and much more. The art and voices are reminiscent of Disney's classic animation series The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.",
