        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the roles of royal twin siblings as they battle to reclaim their kingdom from an evil force. As players traverse through battlefields, they use swords, axes, and spears to defeat monsters and human soldiers in melee-style combat. Battles are often frenetic, highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and bright light effects. Cutscenes can depict additional acts of violence: a man impaled with a sword through the chest; a man stabbed (offscreen) in the stomach by a villain. One female character wears a low-cut top that exposes deep cleavage; in some sequences, the camera lingers or pans slowly over her body."
