    "summary": "Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot is a third-person shooter video game released in 2003 by Treasure Co. Ltd. The game is based on the Dragon Drive series and was only released in Japan. \n \nGameplay[edit] \nDragon Drive was an aerial combat game, set primarily in large, outdoor arenas where players had to face several waves of enemies. With multi-directional dash and lock on abilities, the game has sometimes drawn comparisons to the Zone of the Enders series. \n \nThe game also has a handful of rail shooter levels, drawing frequent comparisons to Sega's Panzer Dragoon series, but these comprise only a very small portion of the game.",
