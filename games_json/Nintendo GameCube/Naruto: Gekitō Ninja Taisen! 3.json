The game was announced on August 3, 2004, and released in Japan on November 20, 2004. The game covers the events of the anime from the Chunin Exams to the Search for Tsunade arc. This installment introduces the ability to change forms during combat and gives some characters a second special attack. Also, the game adds on to the tag-team mode from Clash of Ninja 2, granting the player the ability to use team specials. While this game was released exclusively in Japan, it was later given an enhanced port under the name Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution with less characters.",
