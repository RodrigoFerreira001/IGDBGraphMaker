    "summary": "Sequel to Shikigami no Shiro, SS2 is a vertical-scrolling shooter with sci-fi elements. \n \nAs in most games in the genre, the game puts you in control of a small fighter as you attempt to make your way past several stages filled with enemy ships charging and attacking you in different patterns. \n \nThe game features 7 distinct characters with psychic powers (which manifest in-game as bomb-type attacks and other special moves) and unique fighters, and the game features a story mode for each character, in which they have different dialogue and plot-sequences for each boss fight. \n \nAlso included is a weapon system similar to Psyvariar's in which you can enhance your power and rate of fire by scraping incoming bullets.",
