It was later published in a revamped version by Malibu Comics. A videogame for the Sega Genesis based on the Malibu version was released. \nIn the Malibu version of Ex-Mutants, there were three males (Dillon, Ackroyd and Bud) and three females (Shannon, Piper and Tanya). These six were mutants who were gathered by Professor Kildare, a robotic-looking cyborg and turned into humans. Ackroyd and Shannon were the playable characters in the Sega Genesis game.",
