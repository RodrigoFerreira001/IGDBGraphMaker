    "summary": "Pyramid Magic (\u30d4\u30e9\u30df\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af) is a puzzle-platform game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. \n \nThe basic aim of the game is to get to a goal, which often involves collecting keys, opening chests and moving blocks. A kicks, C jumps. Pressing C twice causes the player to attack blocks underneath the player. Pressing B while next to a stone block allows the player to pick it up, and then he/she can drop it with the same button. \n \nPressing C + Start causes the level to reset. A + Start allows you to skip the level, though this can only be used three times during the course of the game.",
