Play as either Mitch Hunter or Max Steiner as you embark on the most important mission of your life - the complete annihilation of the Dark Legion. Work your way through eight detailed levels filled with all kinds of evil and dangerous mutants as you unload with a barrage of high-powered weapons that are readily available. If the pressure is a little too much for you to handle alone, recruit a friend and try to eliminate the Dark Legion together. The world is in grave danger and only the Doom Troopers can make things right.",
