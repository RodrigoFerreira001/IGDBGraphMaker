    "summary": "Devil Crash (JP)/Devil's Crush (US) is a pinball game ghost-developed by Compile under license from Naxat Soft for the TurboGrafx-16, as part of Naxat's Crush series of pinball games. Technosoft acquired a license to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Devil Crash MD (\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\uff2d\uff24) and releasing it in Japan. They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.",
