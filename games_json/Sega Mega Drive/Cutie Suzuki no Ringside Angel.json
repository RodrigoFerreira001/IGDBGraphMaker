There are four modes: one-player tournament, two-player tournament, two-player match, or watch the computers play with the characters/field of your choice. There are five fields (New Face, Straw Berry, White Snow, Star Light, and Grand Champion). Each field is one half of a normal wrestling ring that the competitors can move around a la Golden Axe",
