After helping the other animals escape, Marsupilami must make his way back to the country he came from - Palombia.\n\nThe aim is to guide his Elephant companion, Bonelli, through the levels, passed obstacles and traps. As he progresses, he gains more abilities by collecting power ups. Each level is timed so each action must be thought about carefully.",
