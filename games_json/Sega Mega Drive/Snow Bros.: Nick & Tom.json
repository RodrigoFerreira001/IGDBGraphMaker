    "summary": "Snow Bros.: Nick & Tom (\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba) is a 1990 arcade game which was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. The game follows two snowmen, Nick and Tom, who must defeat all the on-screen enemies by creating giant snowballs; think Bubble Bobble. It is one of the few Toaplan to Mega Drive ports developed by Toaplan themselves. \n \nThe Mega Drive version adds cutscenes to the game, as well as some more background music and several additional levels. This version was only released in Japan and Korea.",
