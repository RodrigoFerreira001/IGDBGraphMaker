As I step through the fleshy remains of my previous opponent, I realize the metal behemoth I am about to face is more fiercely equipped with deadly roto-bore proton rockets. \n \nI know I represent our final hope as I mount the Federation's newest war machine... the A-7 Trinity Rote Cyborg. \n \nThe signal is given... I must proceed to the dueling ground. Today, death is in the air, and mercy in my guns... so LET 'EM BEG FOR MERCY. - Barrett Jade \n \nIT BRINGS ...A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO DISARM YOUR ENEMY. \n \n- LARGEST 16-BIT CHARACTERS EVER! \n- 16-BIT GRAPHICS \n- 8 MEGABIT \n- ONE PLAYER",
