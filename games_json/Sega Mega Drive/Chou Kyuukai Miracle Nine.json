When batting, the D-pad moves around and A and C swing. When pitching, Left and Right move around and C pitches. Unlike most, if not all, Mega Drive baseball games, however, you can also take control of the rest of the team when the ball has been hit: you control the player with the ball; the D-pad moves around and C throws the ball.",
