    "summary": "Sonic Compilation (released in North America as Sonic Classics 3 in 1) is a video game compilation released for the Sega Mega Drive containing three previously released Sonic titles: Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. It was released for the Mega Drive in July 1995, and rebranded in North America for the Genesis in 1997, making it the last Sonic the Hedgehog series game to be released for said console. \n \nSonic Compilation was the first collection of multiple Sonic games on one cartridge. In some locations, it was bundled with the Mega Drive console during its later years. \n \nThe three games appear in exactly the same form as in their original release.",
