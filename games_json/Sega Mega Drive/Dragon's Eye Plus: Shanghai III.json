It is a member of Activision's Shanghai series of mahjong solitaire games \u2014 to be precise, it is a port of the Japanese version of what the Western market got as Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye; the numbering discrepancy was because of a Japanese Shanghai II that had already been made. \n \nActivision were not happy with this version of the game, and instead produced their own Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye for the Western market.",
