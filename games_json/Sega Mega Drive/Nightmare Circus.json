Afterwards, the Jester was convicted for the deaths of the fire victims, but before he was executed, the Jester warned that the souls of the victims would be forever tormented. Many years later, a Native American man named Raven who had lost relatives to the fire goes to investigate the site where the circus was held, and where strange happenings have been reported.",
