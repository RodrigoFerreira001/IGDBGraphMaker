    "summary": "Battle Mania Dai Gin Jou (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30de\u30cb\u30a2\u5927\u541f\u91b8), sometimes referred to as Battle Mania Daiginjou and Battle Mania 2, is a shoot-'em-up developed and published by VIC Tokai in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in Japan and South Korea. It is the sequel to Battle Mania (which was released in the US as Trouble Shooter). The ROM header's International Title field calls the game Trouble Shooter Vintage; this may have been in the intended name had the game been released overseas, and is another name the game is commonly referred to as. Translation group M.I.J.E.T. translated the game's dialogue text to English and included it with their Tougi Ou King Colossus patch as an extra before releasing it separately later. \n \nA group calling itself the Kikokukyou have resurrected the leader of Blackball, the antagonist group of the original game, and the Trouble Shooters are called to stop Blackball and destroy Kikokukyou.",
