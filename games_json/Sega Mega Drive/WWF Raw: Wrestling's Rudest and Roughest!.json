There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and \"illegal\" acts such as hitting the opponent with a metal folding chair. \n \nThis game supports up to four simultaneous players, and has the following modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.",
