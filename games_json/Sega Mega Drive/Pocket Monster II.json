    "summary": "Pocket Monster II is a platform game for the Mega Drive, probably made by DVS Electronic Co., and the sequel to Pocket Monster, also by DVS. Unlike the first game, no SNES port has yet been discovered. \n \nThis game is a significant improvement over the original. The artwork and audio has improved since the first game, though the former is still mostly stolen from other games. The music is mostly remade from the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon TV series, with songs including the original Japanese opening theme (Stage 1 and Stage 4) and the ending theme of the pilot. (Boss theme.)",
