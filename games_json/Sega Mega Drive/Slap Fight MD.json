Two games are available: a port of Toaplan's 1986 arcade shoot-'em-up Slap Fight with the choice to use either remastered music or the original sound, and a separate game called Slap Fight MD, that has the same gameplay mechanics but new art, levels, weapons, and music (composed by Yuzo Koshiro). The option to switch between Slap Fight and Slap Fight MD is in the Options menu under \"Game Mode,\" with Normal enabling Slap Fight and Special enabling Slap Fight MD.",
