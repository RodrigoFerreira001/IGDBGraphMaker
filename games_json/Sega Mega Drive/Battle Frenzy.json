    "summary": "Battle Frenzy is a 1994 video game developed by Jim Blackler for Domark Software and published by Acclaim in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console in Europe only. A North American release was planned, and even reviewed in gaming magazines,[1][2] but never actually came out. The game was re-released the same year for both the Mega Drive and the Sega CD as Bloodshot, again only in Europe, though the Sega CD version had a homebrew release in North America in 2004. Battle Frenzy was one of the few first person shooters released on the Mega Drive/Genesis.",
