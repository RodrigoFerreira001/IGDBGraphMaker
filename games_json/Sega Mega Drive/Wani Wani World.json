In South Korea, it is known as Ageo Nara (\uc545\uc5b4\ub098\ub77c), which roughly translates to \"Crocodile's Land\". \n \nGameplay is identical to Berlin no Kabe, except C both breaks and destroys a block and you only need one hit to destroy a block. Special items collected throughout the levels are used with B. Each world has nine normal levels, an autoscrolling level forcing you to climb to the boss's chamber, a boss, and then another bonus round.",
