    "summary": "Wrestle War is the name of a video game which was released in the arcades in 1989, and for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console in 1991 in Japan, Australia, and Europe only. and was published and developed by Sega. Despite being released the same year as the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling's WrestleWar pay-per-view, it is not associated with any wrestling promotion. The original Japanese game cover featured a Hulk Hogan look-alike, with a bandana that spelled \"Hogan\". It was changed for the European and US releases for royalties reasons. It did not change the wrestlers faces though, which still are similar to those of real wrestling stars of the time. \n \nWrestle War has also been released as part of the Sega Smash Pack \n \n \nThe player takes control of Bruce Blade, a rookie wrestler, through a series of matches to win the Sega Wrestling Alliance championship belt by facing the following wrestlers, each possessing their unique wrestling moves: \n \nMohawk Kid \nSledge Hammer (based on Bruiser Brody) \nMr. J (based on Jason the Terrible) \nDon Dambuster (based on Road Warrior Hawk) \nNim Rod Falcon (based on Mil Mascaras) \nTitan Morgan (based on Hulk Hogan) \nBuckskin Rogers (based on Stan Hansen) \nGrand Kong (based on Abdullah the Butcher)",
