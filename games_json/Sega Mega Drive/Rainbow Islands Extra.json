The music in extra mode has also been replaced with tunes from that game. The rules are otherwise the same as in the original - create rainbows to defeat enemies and reach the top of the screen. \n \nThe story for both modes is the same: Bubby's friends have been captured and turned into Bubble Dragons by Super Skull Monsta [sic], and Bubby needs to save them by destroying the Super Skull Monsta's minions with rainbows and collecting Little Diamonds to get Magical Mirrors needed to break the spell. \n \nRainbow Islands Extra was only released in Japan.",
