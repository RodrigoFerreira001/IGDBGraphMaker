    "summary": "Langrisser II (\u30e9\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\uff12) is a turn-based strategy game developed by CareerSoft and published by Masaya. Unlike the first Langrisser, Langrisser II was not released outside Asia (nor would any future sequel). Two translation groups translated the game: a nearly complete translation by Hiryuu Honyaku and NoPrgress was released in 2001-2004 before M.I.J.E.T. fully translated the game between 2008 and 2010.",
