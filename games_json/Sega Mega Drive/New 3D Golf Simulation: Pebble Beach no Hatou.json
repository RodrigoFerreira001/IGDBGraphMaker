    "summary": "New 3D Golf Simulation: Pebble Beach no Hatou (\u30da\u30d6\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30c1\u306e\u6ce2\u6d9b) is a 1992 golf game for the PC-98 by T&E Soft in their New 3D Golf Simulation series which takes place at the Pebble Beach Golf Links golf course in California. T&E Soft ported the game to the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 along with three other New 3D Golf Simulation games; however, unlike those three ports, this one did receive an international release under T&E's equivalent True Golf Classics label as Pebble Beach Golf Links. \n \nIt was later brought to the Sega Saturn; in Japan this version was called Pebble Beach Golf Links: Stadler ni Chousen (PEBBLE BEACH GOLF LINKS \uff5e\u30b9\u30bf\u30c9\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u6311\u6226\uff5e). Despite being on a newer system, the game does not take particular advantage of the Saturn's features and continues to use the same rendering style as the entries on previous-generation machines. It does add an overhauled UI, more fluid player animations, and videos of professional golfer Craig Stadler (hence the Japanese name) giving suggestions before each hole.",
