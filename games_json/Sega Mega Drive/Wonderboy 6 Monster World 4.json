    "summary": "The protagonist of this game that combines platforms, action and adventure is Asha, a girl whose spirit has been filled with an adventurous feeling. To continue calling Wonderboy to a game with female protagonist would not have been completely appropriate, so the game ended up titling Monster World IV, without more. \n \nThe story begins when Asha, prompted by a distress call that only she seems to hear, leaves behind her peaceful home and her family to realize their longed for desire to explore the world of Monster World and become a great adventurer. Well, we know that it is her desire thanks to the comments of her parents and neighbors, because she does not express aloud any of her thoughts.",
