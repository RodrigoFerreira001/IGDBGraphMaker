    "summary": "Star Control is a science-fiction wargame which pits the forces of The Alliance of Free Stars against those of the predatory Ur-Quan Hierarchy. The game is designed so that you can ease into play, familiarizing yourself with menus, options, and player controls. The Alliance and Hierarchy each possess seven different types of warships. Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate.\n\nMankind is about to be wiped off the face of the galactic map. A savage clutch of alien races called the Ur-Quan Hierachy has become the \u201cevil empire\u201d of the 27th century- ruthlessly invading interstellar neighbors. Humanity is next on their list. Your job is to make sure that they don\u2019t succeed. The entire Alliance of Free Stars battlefleet awaits your orders.",
