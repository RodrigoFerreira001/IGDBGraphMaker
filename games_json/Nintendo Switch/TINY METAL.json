Luja Lindberg, mentor to Lt. Nathan Gries. Nathan, a young but fierce and patriotic officer, is shocked and saddened with the loss of his commander and father-figure and patiently awaits orders for mobilization. \n \nGiven their long history of conflict, Artemisia wastes no time in deploying Nathan and his small strike force to launch a counter-offensive against Zipang. \n \nEn route to his objective, Nathan receives orders to coordinate efforts with the mercurial White Fangs, led by the infamously cold hearted yet beautiful, Wolfram. \n \nAs Nathan and Wolfram's forces make their way deeper into enemy territory, Zipang's defenses fall easily under the combined assault of Artemisian forces and the White Fangs. \n \nLord Commander Tsukumo of the Zipang forces contemplates courses of action knowing that while his forces vastly outnumber the Artemisian strike-force he must be wary of their skill and not hastily expose any weaknesses. His experience has taught him that not everything is as it first seems... He also must navigate the politics of the other Zipang warlords.\"",
