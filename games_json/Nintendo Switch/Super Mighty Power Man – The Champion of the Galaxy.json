    "summary": "Super Mighty Power Man is a genuine 2D action-platformer game reminiscent of video games from the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s. It is like games found on the NES console when fun was more than QTE, lengthy tutorials, and never-ending cinematics. \n \nSuper Mighty Power Man (SMPM) is greatly inspired by the famous Mega Man game series as well as others including: Castlevania, Contra, Duck Tales, Kirby, Super Mario Bros. and more recent ones like VVVVVV, Retro City Rampage and Shovel Knight. Besides being a true love letter to the NES legendary gaming era, it is above all a tribute to the renowned Blue Bomber and our passion for such games that has stayed with us since childhood. \n \nPlay as Corey, a gutsy kid who accidentally finds himself caught in a most unexpected adventure to save the galaxy.
