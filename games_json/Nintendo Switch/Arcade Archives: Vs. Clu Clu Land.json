It's up to you to find the gold before time runs out! But beware. The Sea Urchin will do everything in his power to stop you. He'll set up traps to trick you, like inviting you into his house where you'll be swallowed alive! Or bounce you against the Rubber Trap and land you flat on your back! But if you, or you and a friend, can control the Sea Urchin by stunning him with electric shockwaves, you just might find out where he's hidden the gold and move on to an exciting bonus round!
