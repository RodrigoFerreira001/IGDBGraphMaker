        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players lead adventurers on a quest to save the world from calamity. As players traverse through environments, they can interact with characters, complete objectives, and battle fantastical creatures (e.g., giant frogs, mechanical beasts, man-eating plants) and human enemies. Players use swords to kill enemies in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by slashing sounds, colorful light effects, and depleting health meters. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a boy impaled with a sword; a child shoved off a cliff. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters/creatures wearing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; camera pans and lingering shots on buttocks and/or breasts; dialogue that states, \u201cYou were staring...Pervert!\u201d During the course of the game, characters make references to alcohol in the dialogue (e.g., \u201cBooze! I want booze,\u201d \u201cCheers love! Get me a beer.\u201d), and patrons can be seen drinking alcohol in the background; one character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d are heard in the game. "
