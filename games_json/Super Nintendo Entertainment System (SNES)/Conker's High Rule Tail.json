    "summary": "Are you ready to play a brand new Zelda 3 adventure? Better yet ... Are you ready to play a brand new Conker adventure? \n \nInitially built as a spiritual sequel to Parallel Worlds, this project has evolved so much overtime that eventually it became an unofficial sequel to an M Rated game that \nwas released late in the Nintendo 64 lifespan, none other than Conker's Bad Fur Day! \n \nIncluding all the same crude humor found in that Conker game and the many references to movies and games we've come to love. \n \nFor obvious reasons, it is also rated ''AO for Adults Only''!",
