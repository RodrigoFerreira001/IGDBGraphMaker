    "summary": "\"The game is essentially an upgrade from Titus Interactive's previous entry in the Crazy Cars franchise, Crazy Cars III. It adds a two player mode and a few more options, the game's most notable feature is its Jazz Fusion soundtrack.\" \nA very cool feature of this game is that your car is damaged in every beat you suffer, and so that it goes back to normal state only by paying a little money later to repair it. \nLamborghini: American Challenge is quite difficult and very time consuming, which generates a good competition. Thankfully you will always have the password on the screen to write down and continue later.",
