    "summary": "The Golden Brett returns to the SNES in the improved and updated BRETT HULL HOCKEY \u201995. The second game in this series also features a full NHLPA license, so you\u2019re sure to find your favorite players ready to hit the ice. Use every little trick in the book to get the job done: one-timers, fake shots, drop passes, and even dekes. \n \nThere are several gameplay options to satisfy any hockey fan: Full Season, Half Season, Playoffs, All-Star Game, and Exhibition. You make all the decisions in the course of a game, whether it\u2019s shuffling your lines, pulling the goalie, or calling the offensive strategy. Choose wisely, because each option could mean the difference between glorious victory and bitter defeat. And with the stellar play-by-play of Al Michaels, you\u2019ll forget that you\u2019re not just watching a game on TV, you\u2019re playing one!",
