    "summary": "Battle Racers is a Mode 7-enabled racing game and part of the Compati Hero Series, which combines characters from Gundam, Kamen Rider and Ultraman. The game takes after Super Mario Kart in its presentation and use of power-ups to get the edge in races. It also uses a similar zoomed-out view of the track for the second player's window for the game's single-player mode. \n \nPlayers select from four Grand Prix cups: each cup has one more track than the one before, starting with four. The final cup is locked until the others have been beaten.",
