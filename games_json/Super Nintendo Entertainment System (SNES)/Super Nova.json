You take to the stars in this horizontal and sometimes vertical scrolling shooter. There are several power-ups to be obtained in your mission to defeat the evil Belser. \n \nThere are three ships to choose from, each having different weapons for attack. There are eight attack levels for each, increasing with each Red Orb collected. The Blue Orb gives a limited defense shield.",
