    "summary": "A visual novel that makes use of sound and text to tell its story. An office block collapses underground after an earthquake, stranding the workers. \n \nZakuro no Aji (\"Taste of Pomegranate\") is a visual novel from Imagineer and adopts the then-popular presentation of using text on static backgrounds with the use of sound effects and music to create atmosphere. \n \nThe game's story concerns a five-story office block that suddenly sinks into the ground after a major earthquake. The protagonist, Domon, and the other office drones are initially panicked, and decide to look for a way out. As Domon makes his way to the basement, any one of a number of different situations can occur dependent on how the player answered some multiple choice questions earlier on.",
