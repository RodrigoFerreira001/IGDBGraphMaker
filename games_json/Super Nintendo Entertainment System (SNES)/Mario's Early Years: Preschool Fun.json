    "summary": "In PRESCHOOL FUN, children develop concepts through the exploration of shapes, colors, sounds, opposites, and numbers. With Mario\u2019s help, your child learns to define and identify these subjects without pressure. Your child simply guides Mario, selecting objects on the screen which Mario bonks and bounces through, frequently affirming your child's correct choice. With Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and all their friends as classmates, your child just may make the biggest stride since learning to walk. \n \nThat's because MARIO'S EARLY YEARS is all about learning to think in a way that doesn\u2019t seem like learning, but much more like playing. Moms and Dads get to interact and play, too. Mario invites them to join in the fun and observe their kids as they become totally involved in the learning process.",
