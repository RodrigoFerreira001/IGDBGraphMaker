It is the second of four games made exclusively for the Super Famicom, all of which have the \"Super\" prefix. \n \nThe five Super Power League games were all licensed by Fuji TV, using their commentators, but Super Power League 2 is the exception: instead, it used the sports commentators of TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System). \n \nHudson would use elements of Super Power League 2 as the basis for The Sporting News: Baseball.",
