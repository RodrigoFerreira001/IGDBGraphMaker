Players can compete in the Jigsaw Mode which allows up to five friends to compete against each other, by taking turns, in a race against time depending upon the difficulty setting (four total). Players can also compete against the computer, complete with power-ups that can help the player such as \"Sweeper\" which takes away half of their opponents completed puzzle. There are eight different categories of puzzles to choose from ranging from sports themes to global locations, each with eight puzzles ranging 36 to 60 pieces in size.",
