    "summary": "This is a simple one screened game that featured Kirby being the ball. It plays somewhat like pinball, where the player must hit the ball in one of the scoring slots, or if he fails to make it in any slot, he gets a strike. The goal is to get as many runs as possible, and just aim for a high score. The game technically plays forever or until the player gets 3 outs, but since there is a limited period for broadcasting the Baseball game, it only lasts as long. There is a 2-player mode available.",
