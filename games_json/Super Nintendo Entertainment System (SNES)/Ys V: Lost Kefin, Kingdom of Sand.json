    "summary": "Ys V: Kefin, The Lost City of Sand is the fifth game of the series. It was released for Snes in 1995. A remake was released for PS2 in 2006. \n \nAdol is travelling through new lands, in search of more adventure, when he hears of the vanished desert city of Kefin. He sets off to investigate this ancient city's disappearance. \n \nThe RPG-style statistical elements and the overhead view of most of the previous games are retained in Ys V. As in Ys III, there is no auto-attack; the player must press a button to swing Adol's sword. Adol is also given the ability to jump and defend with his shield. A new magic system is introduced in Ys V as well, which requires the player to charge up spells by holding a button before they can be cast.",
