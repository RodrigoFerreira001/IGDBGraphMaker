Final Set uses photos of actual people for its various playable tennis characters, and digitized actors as the athletes. \n \nThe game has options for singles and doubles, allowing for up to four human players in doubles mode. There's also a World mode that allows the player to create their own tennis player, and build up stats by defeating other tennis players across the world.",
