    "summary": "Cyber Knight 2 is a direct story sequel to the original (whose translation was also done by Aeon Genesis.) After the Swordfish\u00b4s crew reappears in known space, they are apprehended and imprisoned by the Earth Federation, a new military dictator having seized all of the Swordfish\u00b4s alien technology developed in the distant galaxy. It is a time of civil war amongst the federated planets, and the crew has been thrown directly into the center! Soon, new weapons called Metalliforms are created, which the General intends to use to conquer the galaxy! \n \nThis thing\u00b4s moved really fast. It took just under two months, but it\u00b4s at the point where the game is not only fully playable, but it\u00b4s also one of the nicest pieces of work I\u00b4ve done yet. Seriously, the hacking on this is really pretty. Variable-width font for the main dialogue, multi-line 8x8, text hacked to allow more space... You name it, this thing\u00b4s got all the bells and whistles. \n \nThe gameplay is fantastic, too. It\u00b4s got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over. This game is seriously amazing, folks. I haven\u00b4t had this much fun playtesting a game since Shin Megami Tensei. Even if you didn\u00b4t like the original Cyber Knight, chances are you\u00b4ll love this one. The story\u00b4s better, there\u00b4s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your \"inactive\" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin... The list goes on! It\u00b4s done and there shouldn\u00b4t be any problems, so play and enjoy!",
