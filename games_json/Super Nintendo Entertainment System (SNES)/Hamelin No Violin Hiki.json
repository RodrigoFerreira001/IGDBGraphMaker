    "summary": "Pandora's Box was a cursed existence. Through the curiosity of a woman, evil was unleashed and very nearly covered the world in darkness. Miraculously, humanity managed to seal Maou Kestra back into the box but with immense sacrifices. Even without their lord, the demons are still a formidable force that has only grown stronger with time, locked in the abandoned capital of the north, Hameln. 15 years have passed since that fateful battle... \n \nEnter Hamel, a travelling minstrel who is so self-centered that he'd sooner cook his guardian crow Oboe, than go hungry for even a minute. Welcome to the world of music and hilarious insanity that is the Hamelin No Violin Hiki. Watch as Hamel takes cheap shots at his opponents or how he bashes pigeons with his giant violin and turn them into dinner. \n \nHow WILL the world be saved from Maou Kestra with a hero such as this?",
