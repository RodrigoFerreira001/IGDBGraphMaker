    "summary": "Dream Basketball: Dunk & Hoop is a basketball game from Human Entertainment that was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in late 1994. The player can choose between a regular match of basketball, featuring two baskets and teams of five, or a 3-on-3 mode which is focused on one basket. Up to five human players can join in on either mode, provided a multi-tap peripheral is available. \n \nThe game features sixteen fictional basketball teams as well as one all-star team that is only available in the Exhibition mode. They include: The Photons, the Comets, the Flames, the Vikings, the Arrows, the Tomahawks, the Rollers, the Stingrays, the Langers (possibly meant to be Rangers), the Rings, the Waves, the Wizards, the Unicorns, the Tridents, the Sprinters, the Serpents.
