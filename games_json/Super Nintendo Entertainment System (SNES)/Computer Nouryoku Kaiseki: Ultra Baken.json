Training and preparations are essential to producing a winning horse. When finances are low, horses can be sold to increase the player's bank account. Horses start out as ponies; these ponies must be trained in order for them to commence their horse racing career. The gender of the pony decides whether it becomes a stallion or a mare after successfully mating with a horse of the opposite gender. It is also possible for players to bet on certain horses; including the horses that they have raised during the course of the game to further profit on their success in the horse racing world.",
