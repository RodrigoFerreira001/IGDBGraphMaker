When night comes, help them fall asleep by rocking them or singing them a lullaby. Also, for the first time, take care of two animals at the same time, watch them play together, react to one another and even try to eat each other\u2019s food! From newborns to babies, these cute animals will surprise players with their clumsy and funny personalities.",
