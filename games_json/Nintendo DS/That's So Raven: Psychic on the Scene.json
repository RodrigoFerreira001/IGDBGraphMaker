    "summary": "That's So Raven: Psychic on the Scene is a point-and-click video game that is based on the TV series That's So Raven. In the video game, Raven has to stop the Thompson theater from closing. \n \nGameplay: \nThe player has to go through many places while collecting items and talking to characters. The only way for the player to get inside certain areas is by making Raven change into a disguise. There is a fashion area of the game where the player can change how Raven looks in a variety of ways. There is a small number of mini-games. \n \nReception: \nLucas M. Thomas of IGN said that, \"Most games like this deserve ridicule, but that this one doesn't because the fans will like it. \"Common Sense Media said that the game is well-designed and that it has high entertainment value, but that the game might be too easy for some kids. Matt Paddock of Game Vortex said that the only flaw is the bad grammar and negative talk.",
