        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players travel freely through several fantasy worlds to complete quests and recruit characters to join in adventures. Small characters use swords, staves, claws, and magic to defeat enemies. When players attack with a weapon, a brief light animation appears, along with slashing sound effects, cries of pain, and hit points that float above injured characters. The game contains some mildly suggestive dialogue and depictions; for example, a female character's breasts jiggle slightly during a cutscene; an item called \"Bud of Embarrassment\" is described as \"a virgin's budding flower, which dreams of marrying a prince.\" During the course of the game, players may encounter creatures, settings, and items that depict and reference bathroom humor; for example, a \"Poopie Cube\" environment is inhabited by several \"poop\" or \"poo\" creatures\u2014many shaped like pink coils; others releasing smaller coils from their bodies as rewards to players."
