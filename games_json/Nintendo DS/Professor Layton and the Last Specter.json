        "synopsis": "This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow Professor Layton and his young apprentice as they attempt to solve the mystery behind a ghostly creature. As players solve puzzles and explore town areas, they can trigger various cutscenes, some of which depict violent acts (e.g., characters punching and kicking each other); in one sequence, gunshots ring out before the camera cuts to a character lying on the ground. The dialogue occasionally makes brief references to murder and suicide. Some dialogue includes mildly suggestive references (e.g. \u201cAre your legs tired? Because you've been running through my mind all day\u201d and \"your hair\u2014it looks so soft and . . . touchable.\u201d). In a bonus game, players can select a \u201cdefining trait\u201d for a character (e.g., \u201cFashionissimo,\u201d\u201cSmooth Talker,\u201d\u201cSweet Tooth\u201d).  For \u201cSmooth Talker,\u201d the accompanying text reads, \u201cYour natural charm makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.\u201d Dialogue also includes a few references to wine (e.g., \u201cWe have several aged wines in the cellar\u201d and \u201cOur friend Layton is quite the wine aficionado.\u201d). In one casino environment, players can wager in-game currency on a card game called Higher Lower."

The game includes over 170 puzzles. \nProfessor Layton and the Last Specter also includes an additional role-playing game entitled Professor Layton's London Life, available from the start of the game. London Life, in which players interact with various characters from the series in a town called \"Little London\", was advertised to contain over 100 hours of content. London Life was removed from the European versions of the game in order to prevent a significant delay of the game's release for translation.",
