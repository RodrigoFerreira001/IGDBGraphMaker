Upon arriving at a village that's suitably out of the way for their \"Grandboss\", Gen-An, they decide to stay at an inn when Grandboss wanders off. \n \nWhile trying to find Grandboss, Izuna manages to offend the gods of the village, and everyone in the area starts behaving strangely. Now Izuna has to descend into the various shrines for the gods in order to set things right.",
