        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control 6 characters from the DragonBall TV series and complete a series of quests to save the planet. Players explore landscapes on a map, initiate battle encounters, and engage in turn-based combat against an assortment of enemies (e.g., alien creatures, gun-wielding humans, robots, etc.). Battles are depicted by a flurry of strong punches or flashes of light as characters (on the left and right sides of the screen) take turns attacking each other. Story sequences are presented through text and may include expletives (e.g., \"damn\" and \"hell\") and suggestive references (e.g., \"Keep your hands off me, you old coot\" and \"Her sexy attacks are the best! I wish she'd hit me with one\"). One female enemy is depicted in a bikini and a garter belt and sometimes blows kisses during combat. Another character is depicted sitting on a toilet reading the newspaper. During the course of the game, players may encounter a rabbit creature that is shown smoking a cigarette."
