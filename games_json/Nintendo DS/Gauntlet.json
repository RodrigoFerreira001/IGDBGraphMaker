    "summary": "Gauntlet DS is the cancelled chapter of the popular hack and slash series, that was in development at Backbone Entertainment and it would have been published by Eidos Interactive / Midway Games. The game should have been released in October 2008, but after its initial announcement, the project vanished from their release list. There\u2019s not any official statement, but it\u2019s possible that Gauntlet DS was canned for economic reasons. \n \nThe bankruptcy of Midway Games, owners of the Gauntlet license, could be one of the reasons behind the game\u2019s death. The game would have had local wireless and online four-player mode, 40 maps, and voice chat capabilities. We really hope that in the future a playable version of this game could be leaked and preserved, it looked like an awesome coop-game!",
