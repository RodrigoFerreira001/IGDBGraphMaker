As they interact with characters in the fantasy land of Unova, players can engage in turn-based battles: selecting attack moves (e.g., Tackle, Tail Whip, Slash) from a series of menus. These encounters are accompanied by smacking/zapping sounds, blinking effects, colorful light bursts, and the depletion of health meters. One Pok\u00e9mon is depicted with animated mucous dripping from its nose (\u201cTheir snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky . . .\u201d)."
