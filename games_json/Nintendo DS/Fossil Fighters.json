        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players assume the role of a young boy who travels to an island to find dinosaur fossils. Players can transform the fossils into real dinosaurs and battle them against other dinosaurs in turn-based combat. Attacks (e.g., slashes, bites, and fire/ice attacks) are chosen from a menu system and then briefly displayed in animated sequences. During the course of the game, players can encounter a man who talks about fossils taken from dinosaur droppings (e.g., \"Only you can understand my love for droppings\" and \"My collection of hardened poop is complete.\")."
