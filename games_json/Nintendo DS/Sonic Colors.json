Sonic can use spin attacks to knock over several robot enemies, resulting in punching sound effects, grunts, and brief explosions. One extended boss battle involves a fight between Sonic and a giant robot enemy; explosions and close-up spin attacks accompany the fast-paced battle."

During the game, the camera perspective switches occasionally from third person to side-scrolling. During development, Sega explained that they were delisting sub-standard games in the Sonic series and developing new titles in order to increase the value of the brand. Development included the interchanging perspective, the idea for the game to be set at an amusement park, and a unique music score. Sega revealed that they were developing the game for a wide demographic, which included both older and younger consumers. The game introduces power-ups called Wisps, which the player can use to increase attack power and reach places they cannot otherwise.",
