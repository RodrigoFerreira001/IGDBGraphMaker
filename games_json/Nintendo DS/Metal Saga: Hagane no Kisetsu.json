Noah continued its intent to wipe Earth clean of humanity in this post-apocalyptic world. However, a hunter named Rebanna destroyed Noah before its ambition was fulfilled. Noah foresaw the possibility of its demise, and so devised \"Noah consciousness awakening program\" in this unlikely event and stores it within indestructible super-alloy shell called \"Noah Seed.\" Under this threat, Rebanna's children undertake the task to fight the resurrected supercomputer.",
