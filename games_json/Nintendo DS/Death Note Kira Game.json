    "summary": "A Death Note video game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo DS, titled Death Note Kira Game (\u30c7\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8 \u30ad\u30e9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 Desu N\u014dto Kira G\u0113mu?), was released on February 15, 2007. Kira Game is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in three phases: investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).",
