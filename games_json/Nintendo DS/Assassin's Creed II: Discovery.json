        "synopsis": "This is a side-scrolling action game, set during the Renaissance, in which players assume the role of an assassin fighting against an enemy group known as the Templars. Players traverse rooftops and alleyways, employ stealth attacks to kill targets, and engage in combat by using swords and throwing daggers. The stealth attacks represent the most intense instances of violence and usually require players to sneak up on targets unnoticed. When players stab enemies in the back or chest, a \"blade unsheathing\" noise can be heard as the target falls to the ground and disappears."
