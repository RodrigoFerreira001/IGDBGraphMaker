    "summary": "Babysitting Mania is a simulation-style, time-management game developed by Gogii Games and iWin and available for OS X, Microsoft Windows and the Nintendo DS. The game allows the player to babysit many virtual children while cleaning the house and managing parties all under a certain time limit. The game is available for free as a download from iWin.com. \n \nThe player has a limited amount of time to keep the chaos meter down by clicking items with a red outline, washing clothes, or putting rubbish in the bin. If the player does not manage the chaos, the player will not be able to put the children to bed. If the player does not do it before the parents come home then the player will have to retry the level. To make it more difficult, there are different and larger houses in which the kids get more chaotic.",
