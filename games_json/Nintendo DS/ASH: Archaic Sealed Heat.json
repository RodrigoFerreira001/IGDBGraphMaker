    "storyline": "\"This RPG takes place in a medieval European-like country named Milinia. On her seventeenth birthday, the princess Aisya will be crowned queen. Her subjects are gathered around the palace while her uncle, the regent who has been looking after both the princess and the country in place of the king watches on with great pride. \n \nHowever, this is not to last. For the moment the bracelet of Milinia touches Aisya's wrist a giant flaming serpent descended from the skies and set fire to the whole country. The green, prosperous Milinia and its majestic palace is no more, everything has fallen apart around Aisya when she finally came to her senses. \nWhile the casualties are great, miraculously, some warriors survived the flame, this include the regent. Although they are no longer human, they are alive as ash soldiers. Accompanied by these survivors, Aisya sets off to find out the truth behind the flaming serpent and ways to revive her country.\"",
