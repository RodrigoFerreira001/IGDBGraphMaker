    "storyline": "He appears along with Dragon Sky and Leo Kingdom to give Geo Stelar a trial to determine if he deserves the Star Break when playing the Pegasus version of MegaMan Star Force. After Mega Man defeats his Shadow form, the Star Break is granted, but will manifest only in times of sheer need. Pegasus reappears when Geo learns how to use the Star Break powers and defeats a Jammer. He shows up again when Geo is attacked by a group of Jammers without Omega-Xis, defeating the Jammers and encouraging him to reunite with Omega-Xis, while also granting Geo part of his power - his GX Giga Card. He makes another appearance when Andromeda is defeated asking Cepheus to help rebuild AM. Later the real Pegasus can be fought in Deep Space to earn his Battle Cards.",
