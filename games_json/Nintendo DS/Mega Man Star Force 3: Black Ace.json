Characters use 'battle cards' to defeat robots/aliens on 3D fields in turn-based combat. When characters are hit, a quick burst of light signifies damage. During one cutscene, a boy and a girl are held prisoner, restrained by a blue laser-like force field. In another scene, a character uses the derogatory word scumbags to describe the enemies."
