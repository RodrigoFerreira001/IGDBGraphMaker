Players follow on-screen prompts to hit notes in-time with the music and are scored based on their accuracy. Some song lyrics contain references to violence, (e.g., \"drop dead a bullet to my head\"), alcohol (e.g., \"turn the rich into wine\" and \"we stole and drank champagne\"), and suggestive content (e.g., \"if your body matches what your eyes can do\")."

On-the-go rockers earn more fans and fame by performing their favorite tunes in different styles (e.g. avoiding note bombs, hitting a 300 note streak or playing different guitar tracks) as requested by their fans while they move back and forth between venues (non-linear gameplay). Utilizing the familiar Guitar Hero Guitar Grip peripheral, gamers can shred through 28 master tracks of the hottest Modern Rock.\"",
