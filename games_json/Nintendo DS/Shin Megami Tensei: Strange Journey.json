        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a soldier who, along with an elite squad, investigates an ever-expanding region called \"Schwarzwelt.\" This mysterious region is an \"other dimension\" teeming with demons that want to overtake the world; it is players' job to stop this by traversing through Schwarzwelt's dungeons, negotiating with enemies, and destroying the demons in turn-based battle. Players use swords, firearms, and magic to kill an assortment of demons, zombies, spirits, and slime creatures. Damage is minimally represented: fire images, electricity, bullet holes, a flashing screen. More graphic depictions are presented during ending sequences in which a string of text dialogue is set over still-frame images; some of these images contain large amounts of blood: dark pools covering open terrain; crew members on the ground with blood around their bodies; an operating chair, the surrounding floor\u2014speckled in blood. A handful of female demons wear outfits that completely expose their breasts (though these demons have no nipples); other monsters have phallic-shaped heads and torsos; and a couple of monsters (e.g., \"Succubus\" and \"Incubus\") have sexual characteristics that are detailed in text (e.g., \"They visit sleeping men and have sexual intercourse with them\" and \"It ravishes women while they sleep, impregnating them.\"). Profanity (e.g., \"dipsh*t\" and \"a*shole\") occasionally appears in the dialogue."

    "summary": "In the near future, a mysterious, growing, black void appears at the Earth's southern pole. Unable to determine its cause and powerless to stop its deadly encroachment, humanity sends an elite team of explorers into the heart of the phenomenon, just as Strange Journey's look and feel represent a return to the heart of Shin Megami Tensei, bringing to mind the all-time classic Nocturne. With over 300 demons to bribe, coerce, and negotiate with to gain assistance in battle, Strange Journey is every bit the deep, rewarding RPG experience fans have come to expect from the SMT franchise, yet delivered with a fresh new sci-fi story that taps into mature themes of morality and introspection.",
