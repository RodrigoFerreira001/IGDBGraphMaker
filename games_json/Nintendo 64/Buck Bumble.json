Led by their queen, they are out to destroy everything living thing on the planet, including all insects that dare stop them. \nOnly Buck Bumble, the only bee not to be turned evil by the ways of the queen, can save the world, and his fellow insects, from total destruction. \n \nShoot down swarms of enemy bees, while flying and avoiding the hazards bellow or land on the ground and attack the enemies on foot with various weapons. Also included are a handful of two-player split-screen modes, including Buzz Ball, a unique soccer style game.",
