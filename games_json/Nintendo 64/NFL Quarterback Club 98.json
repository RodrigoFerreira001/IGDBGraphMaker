The same folks that brought you TUROK have turned their attentions to the gridiron and have brought great graphics, realistic action, and lots of options to the sport. With full licenses from the NFL and its athletes, the game has all of the teams and players, plus perfect replications of logos and stadiums. Just to assure that the artificial intelligence was high and the gameplay realistic, the developers coaxed Brett Favre into designing some of the plays.",
