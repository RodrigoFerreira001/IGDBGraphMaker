    "summary": "You can choose from more than 10 characters and enter the ring in the ultimate hand-to-hand competition. Rather than using a two-out-of-three format, you must score seven points in order to win a match. Knocking down your opponent, forcing him out of the ring, or throwing him to the ground score anywhere from one to four points. Try to beat all of the other fighters in the Master Challenge, where a victory results in you learning their fighting skills. If you face the Joker, you must beat him or you will lose the skills you have gained. See how many opponents you can beat before giving up seven points in the Survival mode, or try to see how long you can stay in the ring with a fighting cow in the Rodeo mode. Keep your butt off the ground to win at FIGHTERS DESTINY.",
