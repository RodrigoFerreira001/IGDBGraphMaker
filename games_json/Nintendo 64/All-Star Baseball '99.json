In season and playoff mode, progress is saved via passwords. \n \nOn the field, players will control pitching, fielding and batting (bunts and swings are possible). The game also allows players to set team lineups and positions. \n \nThe game includes all 30 MLB teams of the 1998 season, including the '98 expansion teams Arizona and Tampa Bay.",
