    "summary": "The game is a 3D RPG in which the player character is a child who starts a journey to become a monster breeder on his tenth birthday. After receiving and hatching an egg, the player walks around the world, completing requests from people and raising monsters. Requests are basic RPG quests\u2014such as collecting an item for a non-playable character\u2014and the monsters fight in Pok\u00e9mon-style, turn-based battles. Unlike Pok\u00e9mon, every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, the monster gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters level up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.",
