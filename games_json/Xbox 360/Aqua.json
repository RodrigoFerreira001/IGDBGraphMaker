You command an elite cruiser in the middle of a raging naval war, where masses of enemies and allies engage in real-time operations over large, multi-screen maps. While destroying masses of enemies on- above- and below the water surface, you can unlock new ship-types, weapons and upgrades to enhance your ship. In addition to that, you can form your own special squadron to support you in battle, issuing offensive and defensive orders to overcome masses of enemy opponents and defensive installations.",
