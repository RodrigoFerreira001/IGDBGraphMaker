        "synopsis": "This is real time strategy game (RTS) in which players assume the role of a commander who leads troops into battle against mutant creatures and military infantry in a post-apocalyptic urban environment. Using a third-person perspective, players can issue commands (move, attack, and defend) to a variety of units (e.g., infantry, armored mutants, and mechanized commandos) to complete mission-based objectives. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and screams of pain are heard as units are shot and killed. Faint blood spray is sometimes depicted when units take damage from gunfire and other attacks. Some profanity (e.g., \"f*ck\" and \"sh*t\") can be heard in the dialogue. Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB."
