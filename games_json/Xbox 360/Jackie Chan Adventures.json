    "summary": "Jackie Chan Adventures is based on the hit kid's action cartoon of the same name, which features Jackie as an ancient artifact expert and special agent for the government's secret \"Section 13\". Jade, his 11-year-old tomboy niece quickly becomes his apprentice and partner as they scour the globe looking for sacred talismans and protecting the planet from ancient Chinese demons. Jackie Chan Adventures follows the story of the cartoon series very closely, as Jackie's Uncle sends him to recover 12 ancient talismans. Each talisman unlocks new powers for Jackie, allowing him to access new areas within the game world. A bonus EyeToy mini-game is included.",
