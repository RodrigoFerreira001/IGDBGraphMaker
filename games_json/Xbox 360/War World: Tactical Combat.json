Eventually, the largest groups of these people would form into corporate entities and would establish several neutral cities on the planet in the hopes of establishing commerce with the outside galaxy.", 
    "summary": "War World is a 3D mech combat simulator game developed and published by Australian company Third Wave Games (who are made up of former Rare alumni who have been involved in the development of such games as Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, and others). It was released on Microsoft Windows in 2005, and 2008 for the Xbox Live Arcade service.",
