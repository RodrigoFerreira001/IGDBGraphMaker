Players engage in mini-games that include a variety of activities (e.g., kicking numbered soccer balls at a net, swatting at \"cartoony\" mice that emerge from tubes, protecting a Pac-man character from ghosts). In one mini-game, players' characters are \"bonked\" on the head by oversized boxing gloves if they fail to quickly solve equations."

Some of the games include a math game which requires the player to make hand motions in either a \"greater than\" or \"less than\" sign and a game which makes the user kick a ball into the goal with the right answer for a math question.",
