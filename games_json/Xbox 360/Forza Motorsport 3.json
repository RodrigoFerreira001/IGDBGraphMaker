        "synopsis": "This is a racing simulation game in which players can select and customize real-world cars, speed through realistic tracks, and choose racing events to add to their season calendar. By winning races and setting lap records, players increase their 'driver level' and earn credits to buy new cars. Some song lyrics within the game contain suggestive material (e.g., 'you'd love to take one home . . . but they'll leave you all alone' and 'the future's shining brightly in their thighs')."
