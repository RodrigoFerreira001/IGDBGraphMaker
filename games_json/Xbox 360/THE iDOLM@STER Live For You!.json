    "summary": "The Idolmaster Live For You! is a Japanese live simulation video game in THE iDOLM@STER series and a sequel to THE iDOLM@STER. The gameplay in Live For You! focuses on coordinating the concert event from THE iDOLM@STER with higher customization of the songs, stage and costumes. The game features a rhythm minigame during performances, which was developed to add a sense of unity with the audience and add excitement. The player is also able to freely manipulate how the performance looks by adjusting the position of the camera towards the idols. The story is told from the perspective of a special producer in charge of coordinating the live performances of 11 pop idols from THE iDOLM@STER series. Including downloadable content, the game features 74 songs the idols perform: 32 songs in original versions and 42 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums.",
