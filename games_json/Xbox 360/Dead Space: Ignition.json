    "summary": "Dead Space Ignition is an action puzzle game developed by Megatube and Sumo Digital and published by Electronic Arts for the Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.[1] It is a followup to the survival horror third-person shooter video game Dead Space 2, set between the two main games,[2] which was released on October 12, 2010.[1] The game takes the form of what executive producer Steve Papoutsis describes as an \"interactive comic-style game\" and is written by Antony Johnston, the writer of the Dead Space games and comic book series.[1] \n \nAfter completing the game, players will receive bonus items for Dead Space 2, including a hacker-themed suit with 15% armor and 15 inventory slots, as well as a bonus to the hacking portions of the game. Players also receive a hacker-themed Contact Beam weapon, extra power nodes, health packs, ammunition, and audio logs. These bonuses are found in \"conduit rooms\" unlocked with a Dead Space Ignition completed save file. \n \nThe EA press release outlined the basic plot of Ignition, revealing that the game \"takes place on the Sprawl [the setting of Dead Space 2] and challenges players to survive the initial Necromorph outbreak\", which then sets up the plot of Dead Space 2.[1] Executive producer Steve Papoutsis suggested that the game, the first of a number of related additions to the series, \"will give Dead Space fans a unique perspective on the events leading up to Dead Space 2, and will also introduce the storyline to a brand-new audience of gamers.\"[1][2] Dead Space Ignition takes place before the events of Dead Space 2.[3]",
