        "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players rule a tropical nation by meeting citizens' needs (e.g., food, shelter, entertainment, safety) and gaining influence among foreign powers. As dictator (El Presidente), players can order their secret police to assassinate rebellious citizens. Players can also quell political uprisings by ordering soldiers to shoot rebels/protestors on the street; realistic gunfire and cries of pain can be heard during such conflicts. Various customization menus allow players to assign specific characteristics to dictators, including traits called \u201cwomanizer\u201d and \u201calcoholic.\u201d The womanizer trait includes the description \u201cYou can't sleep with all of them, but at least you must try\u201d; the alcoholic trait references AA meetings and parents who abuse alcohol. In one customization menu, a cigar can be selected as a character accessory. Players can also grow tobacco as an export product, open a cigar shop, construct a pub or rum distillery, and monitor drunken teamsters."
