    "summary": "Joe\u2019s Adventures continues the prodigious crime drama of Mafia II through the eyes of Joe Barbaro, Vito Scaletta\u2019s best friend, during the time that Vito spends in prison. The game add-on extends the original narrative of Mafia II by combining a dramatic storyline with intense arcade-style gameplay that opens up several new areas in Empire Bay and items for players to get their hands dirty with.\n\nImpulsive and unpredictable, Joe Barbaro has been at Vito\u2019s side since childhood. That is, until Vito gets caught and sent to prison. In Joe\u2019s Adventures, Joe uncovers the truth behind Vito\u2019s prison sentence and what\u2019s really going on in the Clemente family.\n\nJoe\u2019s Adventures offers an engaging narrative and allows players to explore new locations, including a train station, the cathouse, a boat yard, a seasonally changing lakefront and some never-before-seen buildings in Empire Bay. This exciting new chapter in the Mafia II saga includes new clothing, collectibles and even more classic 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s music. In addition to the story-based missions, Joe\u2019s Adventures opens up a slew of optional city-based quests packed with arcade action gameplay and a points-based system that allows players to move up the ranks on the online leaderboard through combos and multiplier bonuses. Deadly executions by head shot or charged explosives rack up points, and precision-timed vehicular power slides, lofty jumps and feats of supercharged speed maintain the adrenaline-charged fun for extensive replayability.",
