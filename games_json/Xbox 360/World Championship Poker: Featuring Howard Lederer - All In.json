    "summary": "World Championship Poker: Featuring Howard Lederer \"All In\"[edit] \nThe third game in the series was first released nine months later for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox 360. Reviews for the game were mediocre, receiving an overall score that was lower than its predecessors. GameSpot criticized it for not introducing newer elements as had been done with competing franchises.[4] A version for the Wii was then released in 2007, being developed by Point of View.[5] It is known that the title will allow players to utilize the motion-sensing functionality of the Wii Remote to play the game.",
