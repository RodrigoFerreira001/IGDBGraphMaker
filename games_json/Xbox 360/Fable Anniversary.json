        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of an orphaned boy trained to become a hero in a fantasy kingdom. As players progress through the story, they can engage in combat and use swords, bows, and magic spells to kill bandits and fantasy creatures (e.g., large insects, goblins, skeletons). Combat is accompanied by screams of pain and large splashes of blood. Some attacks (e.g., headshot with a bow) can decapitate human enemies. Some cutscenes also depict torture devices covered in blood. During the course of the game, players can engage in sexual relations with workers at a bordello\u2014sex acts are not depicted, though moaning sounds and suggetive dialogue is often present (e.g., \u201cOn knees, now me want to see you beg\u201d and \u201cYes that's it! Phew that was quite a workout!\u201d). Players' character has the ability to buy and consume alcohol from a bar; screen-distortion effects occur after several drinks. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue."
