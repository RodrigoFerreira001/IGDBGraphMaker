        "synopsis": "In this adventure game, players assume the role of Gabriel, an adventurous teenager who must stop an evil entity in the fictional world of Albion. From a first-person perspective, players use their body movements to solve puzzles, cast magic spells, interact with nearby characters/objects, and defeat fantasy creatures (e.g., goblins, trolls, skeleton-like zombies) in melee-style combat. Conflicts are accompanied by battle cries, slashing sounds, and colorful explosions; some attacks are also highlighted by slow-motion effects. A variety of scenes depict additional acts of violence: a character firing a pistol toward players' screen; still-frame images of a character getting struck by a knife (blood droplets appear in the air). In one cutscene, a dead character is shown lying in a stylized pool of blood. The words \u201cdamn,\u201d\u201cbastard,\u201d and \u201chell\u201d can be heard in the dialogue."
