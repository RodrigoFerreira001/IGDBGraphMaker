    "summary": "The Title is mostly referred to as \"Students of the Round\" in English instead of a more direct translation because an English version of the game was never made and the name is a better match for the English subtitle on the cover.\n \nIt is a dungeon crawling JRPG featuring a bonding system, a trapping mechanic with the ability to lure enemies, and a rivalry system to fight over and steal treasure. It was original released on PC in Japan and was later remade for Xbox 360, under the same name, and Playstation Portable under the name \"Entaku no Seito: The Eternal Legend\". \n\nThe Xbox 360 version of the game has extra content that includes new monsters, items,  dungeons, background music, as well as new story segments and accompanying artwork.\nThe later PSP version is likely to have the new features but I was unable to find information about it. \nThe re-release of the PC version doesn't appear to have the new features but I couldn't find much information for it.\n\nBoth consoles had a special edition released a year after the console ports launch titled \"Entaku no Seito (DRPG Selection)\" on the Xbox 360 and  \"Entaku no Seito: The Eternal Legend (Kadokawa Game Collection)\" on the PlayStation Vita.",
