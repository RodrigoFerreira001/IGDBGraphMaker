        "synopsis": "This is a flight simulation game in which players pilot realistic war planes in combat missions during World War II. Players use machine guns and bombs to destroy enemy aircraft, land vehicles, and ground troops; battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire and fiery plane crashes. Some missions require players to kill groups of fleeing soldiers, who scream and emit splashes of blood before collapsing to the ground. The words \"sh*t\" and \"bastard\" occasionally appear in the dialogue."

    "summary": "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set in a World War I and II scenario. During the seven campaigns the player has to fly and fight through over 48 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose between different aircrafts, each with different strengths and weaknesses. \n \nWithin the missions the player gets different objectives like patrolling, sneaking, hit & run, bombing and escorting. Objectives are presented as dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to control the aircraft. \n \nBeside the campaign the game also features several multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players.",
