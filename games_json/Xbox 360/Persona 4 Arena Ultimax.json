        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles with characters from the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona franchise. Players punch, kick, and use a variety of weapons/magical attacks (e.g., machine guns, giant axes, electrical bursts) to drain opponents' health in melee-style combat. Matches are highlighted by battle cries, impact sounds, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground; one stage depicts red blood splatter in the background. Some cutscenes depict provocative images (e.g., a still image of several female characters wearing swimsuits posed in glamour shots; \u201cfan service\u201d icons that depict female characters wrapped in towels). Throughout the game, one recurring character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cb*tch,\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d can be heard in the dialogue."
