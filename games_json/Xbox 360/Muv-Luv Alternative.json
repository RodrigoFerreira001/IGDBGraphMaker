    "storyline": "In Alternative, Shirogane Takeru wakes up three years after the end of Unlimited to find himself back in his room. Although he first thinks that everything that had happened to him was a dream, he soon feels that something is wrong, and leaves the house to find that he has been sent back in time to the beginning of the events in Unlimited. Unwilling to accept something like Alternative V, he decides to help Professor Kozuki to complete Alternative IV and save mankind.", 
    "summary": "Muv-Luv Alternative is a Japanese visual novel. Unlike the first Muv-Luv game, it consists of only one part: Muv-Luv Alternative. The game continues the story of Shirogane Takeru after the events of the original Muv-Luv. Developers of the game described it as \"a tale of love and courage\" and say it is more serious in contrast to Muv-Luv Unlimited. Unlike previous entries, there is only one ending and one route in Alternative. While it is possible to influence small portions of the story, the ending ultimately remains unchanged. While the initial release of Muv-Luv Alternative was rated for adults only, the game has received releases without the adult content. Plans of a Kickstarter campaign to officially translate the game have been announced.",
