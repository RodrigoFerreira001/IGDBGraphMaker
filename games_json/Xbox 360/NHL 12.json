    "summary": "NHL 12 is an ice hockey video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. The game was released between September 8\u201313, 2011, in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America. The game was featured in the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Steven Stamkos was announced as the game's cover athlete on June 22, 2011, at the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The game notably includes more interactive goalies (i.e. players can have real contact with the goalies and vice versa, and the goalies and skaters may fight each other), better physics engine, improved Be a Pro mode, and the ability to play the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. \n \nLike NHL 11, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 12.",
