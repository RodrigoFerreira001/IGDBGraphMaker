        "synopsis": "This is an arcade-style fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles with a variety of fantasy characters. Players punch, kick, and use melee weapons (e.g., swords, throwing stars, bombs) to deplete opponents' life meters. Combat is highlighted by slashing sounds, battle cries, and colorful impact effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or slammed to the ground. One playable character is depicted with bloodstained bandages around her limbs and neck. Some female fighters are dressed in low-cut outfits; other fighters' breasts jiggle slightly when standing still. The words \u201ca*s\u201d and \u201cgoddamn\u201d are included in the dialogue."
