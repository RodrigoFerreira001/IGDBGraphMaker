In the 22nd century, Mental and his army of grotesquely twisted monsters return to Earth intending to destroy humanity. The humans are quickly overwhelmed and driven back to Earth. As a last resort, humanity uses the \"Time-Lock\". This mysterious Sirian artifact contains the power to transport a single person back to a chosen point in time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam \"Serious\" Stone is chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history.",
