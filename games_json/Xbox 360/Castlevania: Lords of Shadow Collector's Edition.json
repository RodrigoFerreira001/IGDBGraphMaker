    "summary": "Gabriel Belmont learns of a mask with the power to raise the dead and sets out on a mission to obtain it to bring his recently murdered wife back from the dead. \n \nLords of Shadow builds upon the combat systems first explored in this series in 2003's Lament of Innocence and adds more violent kills to the mix. Inspiration for these changes seems to have come from 2005's God of War. \n \nThe Collector's Edition of this game comes in a special clear slipcase and includes a soundtrack CD and a 30-page art book.",
