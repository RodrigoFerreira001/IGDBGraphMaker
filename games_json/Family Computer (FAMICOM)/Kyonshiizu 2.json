The game itself does not have a predecessor: while Phantom Fighter is based on the previous movie in the series, the game came after this one and is unrelated. \n \nThe game plays like a graphical adventure game with menu commands, a popular Famicom genre at the time, with additional action sequences. The player must walk around town hunting for clues about the roaming Jiang Shi (Kyonshi) while occasionally fighting said creatures and other enemies.",
