It is an action game developed by TOSE Software Company. It was released for the Family Computer on November 27, 1986 in Japan. Outside Japan, a graphically altered version released for the North American market in March 1988 under the title of Dragon Power, which divorced the game from the Dragon Ball licensing. A European version which retained the license, simply titled Dragon Ball, was also released in 1990 primarily for the French market. \n \nShenron no Nazo is included as a bonus feature in the Japanese release of Dragon Ball: Origins 2 for Nintendo DS, and it is one of the games included in the game compilation J Legend Retsuden for Nintendo 3DS.",
