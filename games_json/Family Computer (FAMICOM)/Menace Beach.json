    "summary": "Menace Beach is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams in 1990. Like all Color Dreams games, Menace Beach was not officially licensed by Nintendo. It was also re-released as part of the Maxivision 15-in-1 multicart.\nAccording to the game's instruction manual, the player controls a skateboarding hero whose girlfriend, Bunny, has been kidnapped by Demon Dan. An introduction screen shows a shackled Bunny pleading for the player's help. In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, frogs, bombs and bottles, to defeat ninja, clowns and disgruntled dock workers before finally confronting the villainous Demon Dan. The game was somewhat infamous because in-between levels the girlfriend's clothes \"rot\" away, by when the first level is completed, parts of her clothes rot away until the girl is in nothing else but in her bra and panties.",
