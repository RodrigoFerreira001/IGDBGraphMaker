    "storyline": "In Amplitude, the player controls a ship (referred to as a \"Beat Blaster\") moving down a path of varying shapes and lengths, containing up to six tracks. Each color-coded track corresponds to a different aspect of the song, such as percussion, synth, bass, or vocals, and contains a sequence of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is \"captured\" and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.", 
    "summary": "Amplitude is a music/rhythm game and is the sequel to 2001's Frequency. Like it's predecessor, players play songs by hitting notes on multiple tracks representing each instrument found in the song.\r",
