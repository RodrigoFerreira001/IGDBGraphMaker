    "summary": "Another Century's Episode, abbreviated as A.C.E., is a mecha action video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Banpresto. It was released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on January 27, 2005. \nAnother Century's Episode is a fast-paced action title featuring characters, mecha, and story elements from nine famous Japanese anime. However, while Super Robot Wars is known for combining super robots, like Mazinger Z, and real robots, like Mobile Suit Gundam, Another Century's Episode exclusively focuses on real robots (later games, however, have included one to two Super Robot series in their casts).",
