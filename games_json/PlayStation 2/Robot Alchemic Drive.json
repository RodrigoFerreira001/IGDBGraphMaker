    "summary": "Robot Alchemic Driver, or commonly known as RAD, is a Big Robot / Monster fight in a modern city with a twist. There is a story mode / training mode and a 2 player vs mode. In a nut shell, alien\u2019s attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the \u201chero\u201d (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot / hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building / terrain as you battle the alien monster.",
