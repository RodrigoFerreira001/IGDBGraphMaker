    "summary": "Treasure of the Sorcerer King is a stealth action game putting players in the role of anime legend Lupin the 3rd. Together with Jigen and Goemon, Lupin seeks to steal valuable treasures out from under Inspector Zenigata's nose. Players have access to Lupin's wide array of gadgets and disguises, which allow him to pass by guards unnoticed or to get close enough to pick their pockets. \n \nAs a stealth game, Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King plays like an arcade answer to Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell. The game also has puzzles in the classic Resident Evil mode. Lupin plays out from a third-person perspective with a first-person free look option.",
