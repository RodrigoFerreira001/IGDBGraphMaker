    "summary": "Red Card 2003 is Midway's soccer title in its extreme sports series. The gameplay is comparable to NFL Blitz or NHL Hitz. \n \nPlayers choose from one of 32 international teams and duke it out in the most realistic of Midway's 2003 extreme sports games. This game features full size teams and plays much like a real soccer title until you dropkick one of your opponents to the ground. It doesn't go all out like most of Midway's hard-hitting games, but it definitely stands closer to Midway's extreme sports games than a traditional simulation.",
