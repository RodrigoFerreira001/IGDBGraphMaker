    "summary": "NHL 08 is a video game released on September 11, 2007 in North America; the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be released on the same date as the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 versions,[1] but was delayed for a day due to shipping issues. NHL 08 features the Skill Stick System which EA says will allow gamers to more easily control the puck.[2] There is also a way to release the puck and control your player around the defender then retrieve the puck to perform 1-on-1 dekes. It was the first installment of the NHL series to be released on PlayStation 3.",
