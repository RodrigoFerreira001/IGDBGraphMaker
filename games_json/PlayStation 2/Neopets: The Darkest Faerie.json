    "summary": "Players control Tor and Roberta, two animal-like Neopets on a quest against evil. By switching between the two at any time, players can use Tor's up-close melee attacks or cause damage from afar with Roberta's spells. This game stays faithful to the traditional third-person action-adventure. Magical items and weapons gained along the way will develop the characters' abilities and strengths. In particular, elementally-aligned motes can be attached to weapons and armor as a combat bonus. There are many puzzles and side-quests along the way, and players will fight evil Neopets.",
