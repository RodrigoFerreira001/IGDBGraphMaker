    "summary": "Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams os the sixth installment of Capcom's Onimusha overall series, while being the fourth game in the canonical main series. The plot is set in ancient Japan decades after the events of Onimusha 3: Demon Siege and focuses on Soki, a warrior who possesses Oni powers. Soki is on a quest to stop Hideyoshi Toyotomi, who has unified Japan in league with his demonic army of Genma, and he also joins forces with several allies who share the same goal.\n\nWhile game retains the action elements from previous Onimusha, it offers a more varied amount of weapons as well as the option of going back to previous stage to unlock new content. The game also introduces a 3D camera as well as the ability to continuously fight alongside AI controlled characters who move depending on the player's orders. Dawn of Dreams was announced by Capcom due to high fan demand and several Capcom members realizing they could expand the action elements from Onimusha after working in Shadow of Rome. The game was designed in order to appeal to skilled gamers rather than the general market which resulted in appealing designs rather than realistic.\n\nFollowing its release, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams received good critical response. Writers praised the new action and exploration elements but also criticized some elements from its presentation including its dialogues and voice acting. However, the game generated poor sales. Dawn of Dreams also received a film adaptation and two manga spin-offs.",
