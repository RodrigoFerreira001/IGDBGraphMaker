    "summary": "Based on the arcade game, this is a fighting game in the Dragon Ball Z universe, developed by Craft and Master (whose team members include former Street Fighter producer Noritaka Funamizu. Super DBZ is a cell-shaded fighter featuring your favorite Dragon Ball characters. Each character has his own special abilities, with Frieza making use of warps and Trunks using swords for up-close attacks. The game uses a four button setup. Two buttons are reserved for strong and weak attacks. One button is used for guarding with another used for making your character jump. The guard and jump button can be pressed together to execute a dash move. Super DBZ features both ground-based and air-based fighting. Stages are multi-layered, and you can move between different areas, taking the fight to an area that's more advantageous to your character.",
