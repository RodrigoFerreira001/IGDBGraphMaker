    "storyline": "A struggle between light and dark, from 300 years back, is about to ensue. The parties involved are Michel and Albert, the two vampire hunters representing light, and the vampires representing dark. The story takes place in an alternate version of the year 2006 in France, when progress looks stuck in the late 19th century. \n \nMichel and Albert rescue a 12-year-old girl named Caroline who witnessed a couple of villagers held hostage by the vampire sarcoma. After rescuing the villagers and Caroline, the vampire hunters proceed into the castle to destroy the remaining forces of dark. \n \nAlthough the forces of evil reveal that they created Michel and Albert to kill themselves, they became afraid of death and tried to stop them. It is important to note the Hunters are in fact Dhampyrs (half-vampires), foreshadowed by their glowing eyes and sunglasses. The outcome is a pyrrhic victory for the forces of good; as the forces of evil are stopped, the Vampire Hunters decide to let the rising sun end their own lives as well. \n \nThe game ends with Caroline paying her respects to the Vampire Hunters at their graves.",
