    "summary": "In this turn-based dungeon crawler you play as Gil, whose beloved fiancee has been kidnapped by a sorceress and taken to the Tower of Druaga. Gil puts on a suit of armor that radiates light, and proceeds into the dungeon to save his beloved Ki. \n \nThe combat system and exploration might be the best part of the game. The map is set up in a grid, and you do everything in turns, like moving, battling, or recovering. The timing of moves is also critical, and the game feels like a real-time game because you aren't waiting like you typically would for turn-based games. \n \nThe Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino dungeon is a collaboration between the Mysterious Dungeon series and the arcade classic The Tower of Druaga.",
