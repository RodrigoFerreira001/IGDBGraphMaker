Ships and abilities unlocked in Episode Mode can be used here. \n \nEpisode Mode - Players go through missions from the five shows (starting with Enterprise and finishing with Voyager), collecting new ships, and character cards of each generation's command crew, which upgrades their respective ship's capabilities. \n \nMulitiplayer Mode - Players go head to head in combat campaigns to see who can survive the longest in battle. \n \nThe full arsenal of Trek weapons and abilities can be used for each ship, including phasers, photon/quantum torpedoes, shields, scanners, mines, tractor beams, and transporters.",
