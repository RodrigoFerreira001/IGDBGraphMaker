    "summary": "Onimusha 2 is the second installment in the Onimusha series of video games released in May of 2002. Set in ancient Japan, the plot revolves around a new main protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, who is on a quest of revenge as he battles a demon army led by Nobunaga Oda, a sinister warlord who eliminated the Yagyu clan. Across his quest, Jubei learns of his oni heritage which grants him powers to slay the demons and meets new allies who also wish to defeat Nobunaga.\n\nThe game retains the action elements from its predecessor such as the use of multiple special weapons that can be upgraded by defeating enemies. Apart from the main character, the game features four playable sub-characters, each of whom shares a part in the story. The player's actions determine which characters will decide to help Jubei in his quest. These characters were added by the Capcom staff to give a bigger depth to the game and expand the game's feeling of adventure.\n\nPublications for video games generally praised Onimusha 2 for keeping the action elements from its prequel and adding new gameplay elements. Following its release, Onimusha 2 surpassed the sales from Warlords in Japan but the staff was disappointed by its poor sales in Western regions. Nevertheless, the game went to sell almost 2 million becoming one of Capcom's best selling games.",
