    "summary": "Suzuki TT Superbikes features more than 50 vehicles from all over the world, and includes the world famous 37.73 mile Isle of Mann racetrack. For the highest level of realism possible, the course itself has been mapped using data supplied by the government and data captured by the development team. In addition to the traditional racing, the game also features a \"Mad Sunday\" mode that brings riders from all over the world to test their chops on the mountain. Supplementary modes, such as two-player split-screen and sidecar multiplayer are also included, as are bikes from all classes -- from 125cc all the way to the F1 1000ccs!",
