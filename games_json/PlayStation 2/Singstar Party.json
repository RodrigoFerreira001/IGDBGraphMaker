    "summary": "Get the party started with SingStar Party; Sony London's second iteration of its popular karaoke-inspired vocals game developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2. Though gameplay is nearly identical to the previous installment (players are judged on their ability to sing with the correct tone, rhythm, and pitch), a host of new features populate this sequel as well. Boasting more than 30 new tracks and the ability to import 30 more from the original SingStar, the game also supports an all-new competitive Duet Mode, EyeToy compatibility, and a Shuffle Token feature for a more personalized selection of theme songs. Available only in the European territories.",
