    "summary": "Onimusha Blade Warriors, released in Japan as Onimusha Buraiden (\u9b3c\u6b66\u8005 \u7121\u983c\u4f1d?), is a multi-player game from the Onimusha series. Similar to Super Smash Bros., Blade Warriors is a simple 2D fighter game featuring many of the characters of the Onimusha franchise. \n \nPlayers may use standard sword fighting with combos, blocks, block-breaking kicks, jump, switch planes (the different levels of the fighting area), use various items, and disarm their opponents. It also includes the original aspects of the Onimusha series, including the absorption of souls and special elemental attacks (lightning, fire, and wind). The story takes place months after the events in Onimusha 2 and 11 years before the events in Onimusha 3.",
