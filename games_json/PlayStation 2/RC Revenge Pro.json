Luckily, developers from Acclaim's Cheltenham Studios have taken full advantage of the PlayStatation 2 hardware--no longer will tracks be confined to suburban neighborhoods and museums. RC Revenge goes all out to deliver the goods with environments like desert islands and villages wrapped nighttime slumber. And the best part of it all? A level editor for the creative gamer is set to keep the replay value on high",
