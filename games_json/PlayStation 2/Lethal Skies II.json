As a result of resentment and distrust, the World Alliance has begun to split and the seeds for a new global war are being planted. Nowhere is safe, not even the skies. Pick-up and play arcade-style flight shooter, with varying degrees of difficulty for casual and hardcore flight combat fans. Seven new fighter jets for a total of 19 playable planes, including modern-day combat jets, classified \"black ops\" planes and futuristic fighters. Over 20 missions that put the player in command of an Air Force amidst an epic war, with unlockable campaigns that let players switch roles and become the enemy. Amazing new features, including split-screen and i.Link 2-player mode, fully interactive 3D battle maps, movie galleries and five different 1st and 3rd person point of views.",
