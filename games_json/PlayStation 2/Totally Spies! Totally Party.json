To prevent a catastrophic security leak, Jerry, the Center Chief has no choice but to take on them as special agents. The game is primarily based upon a series of mini-games distributed around 10 boards and a showroom. On each board, 1 to 3 players will be able to face-off with a \"bad guy.\" The players must win the mini-games in order to gain popularity points and lay traps against the bad guy. Watch out, the bad guys can also lay traps!",
