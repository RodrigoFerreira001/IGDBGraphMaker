The player can fully customize the vehicles parts, attack moves and appearance, which adds to the replay value of the story mode, consisting of 16 interactive stages, aside from the 2-player mode. Most of the attacks consist or ramming other vehicles or utilizing the mechanical parts that do damage upon impact. The story is furthered through anime-like cut-scenes.",
