    "summary": "A next-gen upgrade of Fisherman's Bait: A Bass Challenge for the PSOne. This one features five different lakes to fish in, each free-roaming and with seven different types of fish to catch including Catfish, Trout and Bass to name a few. There are a 110 different lures to choose from as well as 100 different rod and reel combinations to choose from. To catch fish the players must hit certain buttons when prompted in order to keep the fish hooked, the larger the fish, the faster and harder the sequences. \n \nThere is even a Fish Mood Meter that gives the player tips on why the fish aren't biting and how to remedy the situation. There is also a two-player mode, where friends can take on each other head-to-head or against an AI opponent in a series of mini-games along with the obligatory career mode.",
