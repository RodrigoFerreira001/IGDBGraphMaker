If the usual presentation of EA Sports games was left untouched, other features were changed from the TCM 2004: The 16 player attributes ranging from -1 to 2 become 30 in a 0-99 scale, the 3D engine was retouched with new AI and presentation, and finally, if the player is tired of world class footballing, now there's the opportunity to create a new club, and bring it up from the bottom leagues.",
