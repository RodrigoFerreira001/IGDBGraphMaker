        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players use mechanized robots to battle a rogue military regime. Players use missiles and laser blasters to defeat robot enemies during high-speed aerial combat; players also engage in close combat using large swords or other bladed weapons. Some \u201crescue missions\u201d allow players to destroy buildings that happen to have civilians (screams can be heard)\u2014at the end of the mission, players' score is determined by how many civilians they save. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence: characters getting crushed under a giant robot; a character getting shot in slow motion (small blood stains appear on her torso). In one extended sequence, a severely injured man (he coughs up blood) is depicted amid suspended droplets of blood. One cutscene depicts a partially nude female character, though camera angles obscure any discernible details (i.e., nipples or genitalia). The word \u201cdamn\u201d can be heard several times in the dialogue."

    "storyline": "In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..", 
    "summary": "Take control of a fully armed prototype mechanized robot and fight off enemies during a space colony hijack in Hideo Kojima's Zone of the Enders. In it, players become the character Leo Stenbuck, who sees the consequences of fighting first hand as he learns the true meaning of life and death. Combining state of the art PlayStation 2 graphics, tons of weapons, and an involving storyline, Zone of the Enders also provides a dynamically changing mission structure, a versus mode for two players, and a playable demo of Metal Gear Solid 2: Snake Eater in all first-run production copies.",
