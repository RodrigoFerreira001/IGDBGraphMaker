As seen on the game's front cover, this trio seems human; however, they are actually bio-engineered weapons developed by a company named A.R.M.A. called \"mutanoids\". A notable feature of Crimson Tears is that the levels are generated on the fly using templates, as opposed to predefined game worlds that are the same every time.",
