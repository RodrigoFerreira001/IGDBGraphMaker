    "storyline": "----The one who obtains the Holy Grail will have any wish come true. \n \nThe Holy Grail War. A great ritual that materializes the greatest holy artifact, the Holy Grail. There are two conditions to participate in this ritual: to be a magus, and to be a \"Master\" chosen by the Holy Grail. \n \nThere are seven chosen Masters, and seven classes of Servants; beings akin to superhumans with incredible fighting abilities. There is only one Holy Grail. If you wish for a miracle, prove that you are the strongest with your powers. \n \nEmiya Shirou is a high school student who has learned rudimentary magic from his father and uses it to fix objects. He finds himself engaged in the Holy Grail war as he gets attacked by a Servant. As he gets cornered, he somehow summons his own Servant and manages to stay alive long enough to compete against the other Masters.", 
    "summary": "Fate/stay night is a Japanese visual novel, which was originally released as an adult game. A version of Fate/stay night rated for ages 15 and up titled Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua was released later. Fate/stay night\u200a'\u200bs gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.",
