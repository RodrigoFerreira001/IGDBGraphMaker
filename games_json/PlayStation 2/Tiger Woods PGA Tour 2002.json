    "summary": "PGA Tour is a series of golf video games developed and published by Electronic Arts and later their EA Sports sub-label since 1990, the series primarily features courses featured on the U.S. PGA Tour, and other notable courses (such as those that have hosted majors). \n \nIn 1998, EA began publishing their golf games with the endorsement of Tiger Woods. After Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour and released yearly. \n \nAlthough EA Sports developed most games in the series internally, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the first edition, Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf, which Adrenalin Entertainment developed in conjunction with EA for the PlayStation and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 for the PlayStation, which was developed by Stormfront Studios. IOMO also produced versions of the game for mobile phones for the 2002, 2004, and 2005 editions. \n \nIn October 2013, EA announced that it would end its relationship with Woods, and be replaced by a new golfer on the next instalment. On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy\u2014the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2] \n \nThe series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that \"The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around.\"[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro. \n \nContents [hide] \n1\tGames \n1.1\tOriginal \n1.1.1\tPGA Tour Golf (1990) \n1.1.2\tPGA Tour Golf II (1992) \n1.1.3\tPGA Tour Golf III (1994) \n1.1.4\tPGA Tour 96 (1995) \n1.1.5\tPGA Tour 97 (1996) \n1.1.6\tPGA Tour 98 (1997) \n1.2\tTiger Woods \n1.2.1\tTiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf (1998) \n1.2.2\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 (1999) \n1.2.3\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 (2000) \n1.2.4\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 (2002) \n1.2.5\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002) \n1.2.6\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 (2003) \n1.2.7\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 (2004) \n1.2.8\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 06 (2005) \n1.2.9\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 07 (2006) \n1.2.10\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 08 (2007) \n1.2.11\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 09 (2008) \n1.2.12\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 10 (2009) \n1.2.13\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 11 (2010) \n1.2.14\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 12 (2011) \n1.2.15\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 13 (2012) \n1.2.16\tTiger Woods PGA Tour 14 (2013) \n1.3\tRory McIlroy \n1.3.1\tRory McIlroy PGA Tour (2015) \n1.4\tRelated \n1.4.1\tPGA European Tour (1994) \n1.4.2\tPGA Tour Pro (1997) \n1.4.3\tTiger Woods PGA Tour (2009) \n1.4.4\tTiger Woods PGA Tour Online (2010) \n2\tReferences \n3\tExternal links \n \n \n \nTiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 (2002)[edit] \nMain article: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 \nReleased in 2002 for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube.",
