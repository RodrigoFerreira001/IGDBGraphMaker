    "summary": "Theme Park Roller Coaster aims to deliver a complete amusement park experience. Players can build the coaster of their dreams, and then ride it from a first-person perspective. From that same perspective, you can explore eight environments across four different themes (Lost World, Halloween World, SpaceZone, and Wonder Land), and uncover several hidden mini-games to accompany Theme Park's new physics system and realistic weather effects. As an added bonus, visitors to your creation have brand new features as well: including original skeletal animations and facial expressions that convey their moods. There's even a redesigned interface that was specifically developed for the Dual Shock 2 controller, and an interactive help system to get you well on your way towards building the park you always wanted.",
