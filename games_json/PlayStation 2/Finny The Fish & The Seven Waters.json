    "summary": "Finny is a plucky fish who is charged with the task of restoring calm to the troubled waters that he calls home. These waters are not the seas that Ecco swam in, but are rather some smaller ponds that are connected to short streams and small waterfalls and such. With the ability to jump out of the water to clear some obstacles of climb upstream, Finny has some basic abilities to clear obstacles and explore different areas. He's also hungry and his stomach will help him out as well as get him into trouble.",
