Klein bravely battles the monster, but his Mana strength slowly diminishes. When everything seemed lost, a beautiful young girl named Lita came to Klein\u00b4s rescue.\n\nLita is a monster hunter at the neighboring town of Kavok. She advises Klein that the path to Kavok is dangerous and he will need her help. Klein rejects her advice from his selfish pride, insisting that he will make it through the forest alone. After the two depart, Klein felt ashamed for not thanking Lita for her life saving help.\n\nExiting out from the forest, Klein stood on a cliff overlooking the great plains of Esvior. What he saw from the cliff was a city built upon a steep mountain. The city Klein saw is the infamous city to the Esviore region, known as the city in the sky, Avenberry.\n\nKlein and Lita do not know yet,\nthat the two will knock on the gates of heaven,\nopening the ancient path to the legendary 'city in the sky'.\"",
