    "summary": "Hitting store shelves in a springtime when hundreds of thousands of Hideo Kojima fans were anxiously awaiting the projected summer release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots for PlayStation 3, this PlayStation 2 compilation is presented as an opportunity to catch up on back story, as well as to play (or re-play) through three of the earlier PlayStation consoles' most highly acclaimed stealth games. Included are a PlayStation 2 port of the original PlayStation version of Metal Gear Solid -- the game that some say defined the stealth genre -- and the \"Directors Cut\" editions of its two PS2 sequels, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.",
