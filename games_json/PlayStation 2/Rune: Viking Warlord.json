    "summary": "In Rune: Viking Warlord, players assume the role of Ragnar the Viking; the mightiest warrior of a bygone age. In a land where might makes right, it is Ragnar who doles out justice with the blade of his massive battleaxe. His ultimate goal is to confront the Sark Amen, the shadowy warrior-masters of the netherworld. During his journey, Rune will gain access to 15 different weapons -- including a two-handed sword, magical blades, throwing axes, and war hammers -- as he comes face to face with Dark Vikings, underground dwellers, goblins, and a mysterious race of super beings.",
