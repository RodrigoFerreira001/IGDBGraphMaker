    "summary": "The 'Kero Kero' of the title comes from the onomatopoeia for the sound a frog makes. But no wonder the frog is squawking as it gets hammered around the course in a game of croquet with frogs instead of balls. Various conditions to consider too like in golf such as the wind direction or the fact that the ball is a frog and will jump off spiders webs or launch at passing flies. Allows players to enjoy their own characters in versus mode too.",
