The version of Alpha 2 Gold allows player to select Cammy in all the game modes, including the single-player Arcade Mode (in which she is given her own storyline and ending), not just Versus and Training. The soundtracks for each game are from the arcade version, with the exception of Alpha 2 Gold, which uses the arranged soundtrack from the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions. The original Alpha gives player a choice between CP System and CPS II-style soundtracks (the former is based on the CPS Changer version of the game). \n \nAll the games in the compilation includes the standard Arcade, Versus and Training modes, as well as Survival mode and Dramatic Battle for the Alpha games. The Dramatic Battle mode featured in the original Alpha, Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 Gold is the same one featured in the Japanese arcade version of Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, allowing players to create their own team of characters and fight against a specific series of opponents (Adon, Sagat, M. Bison and Akuma). The original Dramatic Battle mode from the first Alpha, which features Ryu and Ken against Bison, is still available in the game as a secret feature.",

The game also includes a remixed version of the console-exclusive Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold and Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix (previously released on the PlayStation as Pocket Fighter), as well as two secret games.",
