This game lets you interact with the environment like never before in the Time Crisis series--shoot CDs and books off of store shelves, burn racks of clothing, break glass, or slice through metal bars. Now you can wield two GunCon2s to take down your enemies. Time Crisis: Crisis Zone also includes new enemies, gameplay modes, weapons, and game settings.",
