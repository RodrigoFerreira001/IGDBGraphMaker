    "summary": "Psi-Ops is an action game with a twist: no longer do you have to rely solely on big weapons and explosions to progress through it - you also have the aid of psychic powers to take down army after army of enemy soldiers. \n \nIn the game you take the role of Nick Scryer, a secret agent who had his face reconstructed and mind wiped clean in order to infiltrate a growing psychic organization calling itself The Movement. Nick, however, is captured, but manages to free himself and continue his mission to stop The Movement, regaining his psychic abilities along the way. \n \nThe game mixes regular weapons with the weapons of the mind. You'll have access to a series of mind powers, such as Telekinesis (the ability to fling object and soldiers around), Pyrokineses (the ability to set things on fire), Mind Drain (for draining Psi power out of foes' minds) and Remote Viewing (leaving your body behind and exploring the level).",
