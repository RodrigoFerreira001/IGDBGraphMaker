    "summary": "Jack of All Trade's FUNKMASTER FLEX DIGITAL HITZ FACTORY for the PS2 provides players with everything they need to make and mix their own sounds like pros. HITZ FACTORY includes over 16,000 instrument sounds and different musical styles for players to mix and match into their own songs. Players can select from among different styles like hip hop, pop, trance, garage indy, and metal, then add, mix, and modify clips from the thousands available to create their own unique songs. HITZ FACTORY also supports USB microphones, so players can even record their own music or vocals to include. Vocals will be analyzed and a new musical riff will be created based off of player's pitch and range. Players can then hear what they just sang as if it was played on a guitar, the drums, or other instruments. HITZ FACTORY also lets players create music videos to go with the music by blending several of the more than 500 clips available into their own video. Up to four different clips can be layered together then mixed with different effects like color, kaleidoscopes, and more. Finally, the DJ Supermixer mode lets players be the DJ with a set of virtual decks to spin. Players who want to work in the music industry or create their own music will love FUNKMASTER FLEX DIGITAL HITZ FACTORY. By turning the PS2 into a recording studio, musicians will be able to make their own songs in no time.",
