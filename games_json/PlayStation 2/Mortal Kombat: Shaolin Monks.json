    "storyline": "The battle raged furiously on Shang Tsung's island fortress in the Lost Sea. While the demon sorcerer watches from his throne, several fights occur. The Shaolin monk Liu Kang defeats Shang Tsung, and the giant Goro comes to his defense. With Goro distracting everyone else, Shang Tsung creates a portal to Outworld and retreats. Raiden appears afterwards and warns the remaining fighters to get off the island palace because it is collapsing into the sea.\n\nEveryone, except Liu Kang and Kung Lao, evacuates and escape back to the Wu Shi Academy. Liu Kang and Kung Lao, however, have to fight their way to another portal to get to Wushi Academy. Upon arrival, they meet Baraka and the Tarkatan attacking the Wu Shi Academy. The Tarkatans are defeated, but Baraka captures Sonya Blade. Raiden confirms that Shang Tsung is trying to lure Liu Kang and his allies to Outworld where he can order his henchmen to attack them and bide his time for power. If successful, Shang Tsung will conquer Earth without winning a Mortal Kombat tournament, which is cheating.\n\nThe Shaolin Monks, Liu Kang and Kung Lao, journey through the nightmarish realm of Outworld to stop the sorcerer's plot. They are guided by Raiden and assisted by Johnny Cage. Throughout their journeys, they are joined by a mysterious princess named Kitana, meet familiar foes and eventually save Sonya and stop Shang Tsung. But the sorcerer is not the only person who wants Earth; the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, wants Earth for his realm and he will stop at nothing until he gets it.",

Shaolin Monks was developed by Midway LA (formerly Paradox Development) and published by Midway for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and was released September 16, 2005 in the United States. A Nintendo Gamecube,PlayStation Portable Versions Were Planned But it Was Cancelled. A Game Boy Advance And Nintendo DS Versions Were Also Cancelled Because they felt the game was not for kids under seventeen years old. In October 2004, the president of Midway, David F. Zucker, called the release of Shaolin Monks the \"first step toward delivering something that Mortal Kombat fans have been calling for: a new game set in the Mortal Kombat universe every year.",
