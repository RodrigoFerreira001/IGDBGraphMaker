The player controls Stitch, using his powers to the fullest: climbing walls and ceilings, dashing with amazing speed, shooting up to four weapons at once (one in each hand), flying with the jetpack, and swinging using the grapple gun. The game features several of the film's memorable characters, including Jumba, Gantu, and Grand Councilwoman.",
