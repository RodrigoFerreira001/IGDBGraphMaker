    "summary": "When the ice in the Siberian region melts, a worldwide catastrophe occurs and 90% of the earth is submerged under water. Lifting the major cities and providing assistance is the objective of the newly formed World Alliance, comprised of most of the surviving nations. Opposing the World Alliance are terrorist and militant countries who banded together under WORF (World Order Reorganization Front) looking to profit from the disaster. With global war imminent, the World Alliance organizes a multi-national military organization known as Frontier Nations and its air force, Team SW. \n \nLethal Skies: Elite Pilot: Team SW is a realistic combat flight simulator for the single player. It features vibration and G-force effects, 2 cockpit views as well as 3rd person and full screen, mid-air refuelling (in certain situations), 14 different missiles for air-to-air and air-to-ground battles, radar, and GPS. Change pilots, planes and weapons in the Hangar. Depending upon the scenario, take off from runways or aircraft carriers. Select Replay to view completed, saved missions. \n \nThe Training Modes are: \nMission - take offs and landing, air-to-air attack, air-to-ground attack, combination \nDogfight - simulated battles against the computer (one-on-one to four-on-four) \nFree Flight - fly freely in different stages without enemy confrontation \n \nThe heart of the game takes place in Campaign Mode which has 20 missions selected from a world map. A preliminary briefing and information about the enemy is provided for each mission. \n \nChoose to control these fighter planes: \n \n  F-14D Super Tomcat \n  F-16 Fighting Falcon \n  F/A-18E Super Hornet \n  F-15E Strike Eagle \n  F-22 Raptor \n  EF2000 Typhoon \n  JAS39 Gripen \n  MiG29 Fulcrum \n  Su27 Flanker",
