Once there, he discovers that the base has been taken over by alien invaders who plan to use it to launch an attack on Earth. Wheeler must use all his wits and skills to prevent this from happening. \n \nRTX: Red Rock is a third-person action-adventure game which splits itself between combat with a multitude of weapons and some puzzle-solving. The protagonist is also equipped with a robotic arm with multiple attachments and a 'bionic' eye which gives him four different vision modes.
