    "summary": "In Homura, you take control of a samurai in a fantasy take on Japan's Edo period, as the samurai flies through vertically scrolling shooting stages. You can make your samurai shoot, use a screen-clearing bomb and perform a slash with his sword. The slash move forms the core of Homura's gameplay, as by slashing enemy bullets, you can send them back at the enemy. Homura features multi-form bosses and four stages of play, with stages one through three branching off into multiple paths. The game is based on an arcade title.",
