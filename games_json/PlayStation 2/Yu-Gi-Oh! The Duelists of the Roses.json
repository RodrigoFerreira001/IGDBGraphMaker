This is the first game from the series to be released on PlayStation 2 format.\nThe video game has loosely been based on the real-world Wars of the Roses. Yami Yugi (Yugi Mutou in the English anime and the original Japanese adaptations) could assume the identity of the head of the Tudor dynasty, Henry Tudor, while Seto Kaiba would represent the head of the Yorkist clan force as Christian Rosenkreuz.\nUpon its release, \"Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelist of Roses received mixed reviews from most game critics, with many critics praising the game for its graphic design and appeal, but criticizing its tedious gameplay and lack of fair challenge. It was a commercial success though, being recognized as one of the best-selling PlayStation 2 games to date, selling over one million copies worldwide. In mid-2006, The Duelists of the Roses was named a PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits title.",
