Now in full 3D and blending humor, suspense, and blinding speed, Rayman must escape an intergalactic zoo by using the powers of his still-imprisoned friends to open the door to an even greater power to free them. Unique to the PS2 version of the game are a number of brand new stages, a harder difficulty level, and a progressive upgrade system that gives Rayman a number of abilities not found in other iterations.",
