    "summary": "Long ago, during the first age, an evil spell to bridge our world and the one of darkness was stopped before it could be used. The spell could not be destroyed, so instead, it was broken into six separate parts and scattered about the world. As time passed, all forgot what these marks were for, and mankind dismissed the ancient warnings about these words of power. Then after a millennia, to their dark joy, the spells were rediscovered...\n\nAs the powerful warrior Rau, you embark on a quests to rid the land of the barbarians and thieves that have come to power in this lawless realm, one that will eventually have him battling to once again stop the spell. Using a unique control system, Rau can take on multiple enemies at once, even when surrounded, and can also take out enemies with a bow, sneak up and kill with silent stealth moves, and use his magical bird Kuzo to scout the land.",
