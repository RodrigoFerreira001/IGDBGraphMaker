    "summary": "Raccoon City has been infected by the Umbrella corporations deadly T-Virus. A mutagenic toxin that turns its human victims into flesh eating zombies. The few survivors must try to escape the city before the government deploys its final solution to the problem of Raccoon City... \n \nOnce again you find yourself playing the eight characters of the original Resident Evil: Outbreak in more scenarios set in the ruins of what used to be Raccoon City. \n \nThe new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe. \n \nThe locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil: Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.",
