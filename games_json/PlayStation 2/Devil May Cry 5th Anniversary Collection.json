    "summary": "The 5th Anniversary Collection is simply a repackaging of the first three games of the series. It comes on four DVD discs; one for Devil May Cry, two for Devil May Cry 2, and the fourth for Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition. Unlike the HD Collection, which was released in 2011, the 5th Anniversary Collection features no additional content or updates, and served simply to commemorate the 5th birthday of the Devil May Cry series. Additionally, its $29.99[2] price tag made it more cost effective to buy the collection than each game individually.",
