    "summary": "The king of the Country of Forest in Felix sent out a proclamation all throughout Felix announcing that he was seeking a suitable young man to take his beloved daughter as a bride. Many suitors responded and were subsequently put through a large variety of trials by the king. In the end, the decision was narrowed down to two suitors. One was the prince of the Country of Lakes in Felix, and the other was a wizard who had used his powers to transform himself into a handsome young man. \n \nThe princess' heart was set upon the prince of the Country of Lakes, and the two proclaimed their love for one another with an oath. However, after learning about this, the wizard transformed himself into the shape of the prince in order to take the princess for himself. He placed a curse upon the prince and transported him far from Felix, to the other end of the world.",
