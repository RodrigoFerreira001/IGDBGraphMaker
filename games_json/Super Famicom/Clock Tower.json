She and her friends, who are also orphans (Laura Harrington, Anne and Lotte) are adopted in September 1995 (the same month the game was released) by a wealthy recluse named Simon Barrows, who lives in a mansion known as the \"Clock Tower\", named after its predominant feature.\n\nThe game immediately begins with these characters walking towards the Barrows mansion and settling in the main foyer. Mary, the woman who brought the children to the mansion, leaves to find Mr. Barrows, but she takes an unusually long time. Jennifer offers to investigate, but upon leaving the room, a scream is heard from the main foyer. Jennifer returns to find the lights are off and the girls are missing.",
