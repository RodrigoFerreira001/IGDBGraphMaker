    "summary": "Ancient Magic is a fairly generic little RPG for the SNES by the much-maligned Hot-B. See if you can spot their advert for another of their products in the game! Despite its rather pedestrian roots, the game takes several surprising twists towards the end, and is generally worth sticking it out even if the wrap-up (or lack thereof) is a bit of a let down. As a note, there\u2019s more game past \u201cTHE END.\u201d Also as a note, do set your window speed to \u201cfast\u201d in the in-game options menus - it\u2019ll improve your experience dramatically.",
