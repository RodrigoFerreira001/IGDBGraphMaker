He make kick in eight directions with whichever foot is not planted in the ground at the given moment. Power ups are revealed by kicking trees, flowers, mushrooms, and other obstacles that are scattered throughout each stage. They may take the form of shoes which grant him the ability move on certain surfaces, or candy which gives him special abilities. Each stage has a \"back side\" which is accessed by stepping on holes in the ground reveal under kicked obstacles, and provide more power-ups to find.",
