    "summary": "Mahjong Kazoku is a Mahjong game released only in Japan for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nMahjong Kazoku (\"Mahjong Family\") is a standard Mahjong simulation game for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game. \n \nIrem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.",
