    "summary": "Puzzle Boys is the second game in the Puzzle Boy series of 5 games. The first game is the most well known, released as Kwirk on the GameBoy in North America. This is Atlus\u2019s only FDS game, and a late one at that, as the FDS was pratically dead by the time the GameBoy came out. This game improves on Kwirk by adding color, a really fun two player on the same screen mode with the ability to handicap the better player, and way more puzzles in Puzzle Challenge Mode, 80 vs. Kwirk\u2019s 30. (from Romhacking.net game translation page) \n \nNOTE: I cannot find boxart for this game anywhere, so I just uploaded a picture of the FDS disk for it.",
