It is the sequel to Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race, although the two games are very different. The game play is similar to that of Rad Racer, which was released before it. Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally marks the first time that Luigi appears taller and thinner than Mario on a box art. The game was never released in America or Europe. HAL Laboratory didn't develop the game, though were assigned by Nintendo to redesign the floppy disks and program it into it once the disks were malfunctioning. \n \n In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a song that was present in 3D Hot Rally was recreated for the Mario Circuit stage, while the car made an appearance as a kart the player could choose in Mario Kart Wii. In 2001, the Monster car was present as a trophy in the GameCube classic Super Smash Bros. Melee.",
