    "summary": "Nicol is a young genius who developed the technology to transport equipment across dimensions of space. News about this discovery spread throughout the galaxy, and now a menacing threat from a distant star system is determined to get their hands on that technology for their own purposes. To do that, a demon has kidnapped Nicol's girlfriend Stella, and is holding her captive until he gets the technology. She waits helplessly behind the demon's chamber, never giving up hope that her true love Nicol will come to save her. \n \nAs a result, Nicol decides to take on the entire invading alien race to save Stella, which means he must navigate a bunch of maze-like levels, collecting powerups and hitting switches to progress. Your goal in each stage is to collect three different diamonds to power your hovercraft to the next area, and many are, naturally, guarded by bosses.",
