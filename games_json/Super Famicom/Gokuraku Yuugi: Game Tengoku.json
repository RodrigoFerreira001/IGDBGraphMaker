    "summary": "An assortment of eight party games developed and published by Sofel for the Famicom Disk System. Most are based around gambling. \n \nSOFEL's Gokuraku Yuugi: Game Tengoku (\"Paradise Play: Game Heaven\" - no relation to Rhythm Heaven) is a mini-game collection that provides eight different types of game framed as different stations on a TV. \n \nThe games are variations on: \n \nBingo \nRoulette \nDice \nSlots \nBlackjack \nPoker \nConcentration (a.k.a. Memory or Pairs) \nSpeed (a.k.a. Spit) \n \nThe Bingo and Dice games have no scoring system in-game; rather, they are simulations of a randomization process that players can use with their own physical scoring systems at home (such as bingo cards or Yahtzee/Dice Poker sheets).",
