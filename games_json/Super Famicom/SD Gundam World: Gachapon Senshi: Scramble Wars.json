    "summary": "Two teams, the blue army and the red army, compete on tiled maps in an attempt to vanquish one another in battle. Each team starts off in one particular portion of the map, usually but not always on opposite sides. Throughout the map are cities which start out neutral, but can be converted to the red or blue side through occupation. The more cities a team has, the more energy that team produces every round to direct toward the construction of newer and more powerful Gundams. Each team gets to issue three commands per turn, whether it be to move a Gundam around the map, or construct a new Gundam. Each type of robot has different ranges of movement, and different terrains effect how far a robot can travel. In order to destroy each other, players must attack the opposing team's Gundams by moving one of their own to a tile occupied by the enemy. When two Gundams rest on the same spot, a battle is initiated.",
