Cars have a certain amount of health and fuel, which decreases whenever the player crashes into a wall or another car, as well as whenever he or she drives off of the road. The player can go to a pit-stop to regenerate the health and fuel; however, doing this takes away race time. Winning the Grand Prix rewards players with coins (Money), which can be used to unlock hidden cars.",
