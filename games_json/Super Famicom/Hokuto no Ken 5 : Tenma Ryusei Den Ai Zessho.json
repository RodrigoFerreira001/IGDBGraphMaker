But in one generation, in order to oppose the tyranny of their next heir, a group of high priests raised his younger brother to be the Tentei, granting him the power to fight the Mak\u014dtei clan. From that point, an age of conflict began between the Mak\u014dtei and Tentei, setting rightfulness against heresy. \n \nA wedding ceremony was taking place in a church. As the young couple were vowing their love for each other, the Imperial Army of the Mak\u014dtei suddenly attacked, taking the bride with them. The young man has now began a journey to rescue his fiancee. \n \nThe Mak\u014dtei's army's attacks were extremely severe. The martial arts sworn to protect the Tentei, namely the ones from the Hokuto, Nanto, and Gento schools, attacked with nothing but raging fire.

The world was in turmoil, as it become governed by pain and misery. Time has been waiting for the revival of the Tenteiken, the only martial art capable of defeating the Mak\u014dtei. Only Kenshiro, the greatest master of Hokuto Shinken, holds the key. \n \nIn a turbulent time filled with sorrow, a group of passionate men bear the scars of their emotions, as they now challenge the Mak\u014dtei to a final battle.",
