    "summary": "I Am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater was designed to be a sewing simulator. Players were able to design sweaters, adding pictures of famous characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser in the process. It was devised by Royal industries Co. Ltd., a Japanese appliance and sewing machine company. \n \nRoyal industries Co. Ltd. realized that they could profit from a sweater-design program, which led to the development of this game. The company eventually made a real-life version of the game.",
