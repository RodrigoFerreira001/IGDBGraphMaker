    "summary": "The year is 1995, and the impending turn of the 20th century is instilling fear and uncertainty in mankind, and fortune telling shows have become popular. \n \nOn September 25, 1995, a young boy living in Tokyo hears on a fortune telling show that he will meet the girl of his dreams in a museum located outside the city limits. He visits the \"Devil Museum\" and meets a girl inside, but a sudden earthquake cuts their meeting short. The boy recites the incantation from the fortune-telling show said to \"capture the heart of the girl of his dreams\", but the incantation destroys the seal on a vase containing the devil. \n \nThe reanimated devil takes control of the boy's body, leaving the boy trapped in the devil's decaying body. He chases the devil to the house of Dr. Simon, a physics scientist hiding from the media. The devil has stolen the scientist's time machine called the \"Time Belt\" and uses it to travel back in time. The young boy's soul is also pulled back into the past by the Time Belt.",
