Jinguji is invited to visits a race circuit where the motorcycle racer, Okazaki, suddenly crashes, but a different racer's body is recovered at the crash site. At the same time Okazaki's wife is found dead. \n \nTantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari is the third game in the Jinguuji Saburo series, known in the West as Jake Hunter. It was originally released across two Famicom Disk System disks, the second of which went on sale several months after the first. The game was eventually localized, as part of the Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles DS compilation of his early cases, as Jake Hunter: Crash and Burn. \n \nIn this game Detective Jinguuji Saburo/Jake Hunter must solve the mystery behind a sudden death during a motorcycle race. The intrigue is deepened when the body recovered is actually of a different racer.",
