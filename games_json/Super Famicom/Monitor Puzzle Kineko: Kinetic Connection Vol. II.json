    "summary": "An image puzzle game and the follow up to the original Kinetic Connection. It was developed by Tamtex and published by Irem for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nKinetic Connection Vol. 2 (or Monitor Puzzle Kineco: Kinetic Connection Vol. 2 to give it its full title) is a follow up to Tamtex's Kinetic Connection, featuring more animated pictures to craft from composite pieces similarly to a jigsaw puzzle. As with its forebear, the trick to Kinetic Connection Vol 2 is to closely observe the moving parts in each of the pieces as the animation goes through its loop in order to glean hints as to where each piece belongs. \n \nThough very much simply more of the same, the new puzzles have some interesting ideas behind them. The hardest puzzle happens to be a Defender-like game that responds to the player's movements as they try to assemble the puzzle.",
