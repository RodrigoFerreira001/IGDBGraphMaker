Together with a mysterious woman named Apsu, they desire to twist time and change the destiny of the Earth. \n \nIn the present day, the Sailor Senshi are enjoying peace now that the Death Busters have been defeated. However, strange things begin happening in the city. Previously defeated Daimons, Droids and Youma appear throughout the city. A visit by Ryo Urawa reveals a cryptic statement that the past and future are being replaced. Rei sees strange apparitions in the fire, and then the four Inner Senshi, along with Chibiusa go missing. Sailor Moon meets up with Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn to go look for the missing Senshi.",
