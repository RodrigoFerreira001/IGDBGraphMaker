In it, due to a natural disaster, the world has been split into three distinct parts; the surface world, simply called Oterra, the floating islands, called Medonia, and the Tempest Rift which acts as a barrier between the other two areas. Episode 1 takes place in Medonia; where the floating islands are slowly losing their energy, and as such, ability to continue to remain afloat.", 
    "summary": "Soul Saga is a traditional role-playing video game in the vein of the Final Fantasy, Suikoden, Breath of Fire, and Persona video game series. Battles are initiated similarly to Chrono Trigger, where combat begins upon the player directing the character into an enemy in the world map. Once initiated, combat consists of a turn based battle system similar to Final Fantasy X. The game will also have airship battles, similar to Skies of Arcadia. \n \nExploration of the overworld map will also be a major aspect of gameplay, with the player being able to explore on foot similarly to Final Fantasy VII, and by airship similarly to Skies of Arcadia.",
