        "synopsis": "This is a strategy role-playing game in which players help a band of characters battle a demon emperor in a fantasy world. From a 3/4 overheard perspective, players maneuver characters around a grid-based battlefield, fighting monsters/demons and human-like characters in turn-based combat. Damage is indicated by colorful light effects, large explosions, and cries of pain. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters wearing outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; a female demon pole-dancing on stage; dialogue/text such as \u201cHey, you peeping Toms\u201d and \u201cA Nekomata's way of dealing with sexual harassment.' During the course of the game, players obtain a Hard Liquor item, which can be used to bribe senators; text on screen reads \u201cDrunk\u201d/ \u201cDrunken\u201d to describe characters. The word \u201csh*t\u201d is heard in dialogue."

The evil demon emperor Void Dark devastates numerous Netherworlds after coming to power, with the help of an army of over one million soldiers known as The Lost. Following this, the Overlords of the Netherworlds under Void Dark's rule attempt to rise up and take revenge. The game involves the player traveling across different Netherworlds in an attempt to bring the Overlords and heirs of each different world to join forces together to fight against Void Dark. The game will feature new systems not seen within prior titles in the Disgaea series. In addition, the number of characters displayable on-screen has increased to 100, compared to 10 characters on the earlier PlayStation 3 titles.",
