        "synopsis": "This is a VR adventure game in which players watch events of a murder mystery as it unfolds in a Victorian mansion in the late 19th century. Players can manipulate time (e.g., fast forward, rewind, stop) as they follow characters and listen in on their conversations. Some conversations can lead to various acts of violence: a woman stabbed in the chest with a knife; a man electrocuted by lightning; a man stabbed in the stomach. In one interaction, a character bleeds on the floor after being slashed across the neck by an assailant. Some interactions can also lead to suggestive innuendo and dialogue (e.g., \"You want to make love to me\"; \u201cI'm not sure I can entertain all three of you at once\u201d; \u201cUs working girls never forget a face...You took me off the streets in Whitechapel, all the way up to that fancy hotel room.\u201d). The game includes some alcohol references (e.g., \u201cYou are drunk,\u201d \u201cPerhaps you should lay off the booze,\u201d and \u201cYou're nothing but a drunk.\u201d); one character is depicted drinking whisky from a bottle. The word \u201cb*tch\u201d is heard in the dialogue. "
