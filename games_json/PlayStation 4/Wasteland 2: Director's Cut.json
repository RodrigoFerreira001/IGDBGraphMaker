        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players lead a law enforcement faction to investigate a threat in a post-apocalyptic desert. From a 3/4 over-head view, players traverse barren landscapes, interact with characters, and fight other human survivors and fantastical enemies (e.g., robots, mutant creatures, giant insects). Players use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, blades, and explosives to kill enemies in turn-based combat. Some attacks result in decapitations and dismemberment, with large blood pools/blood-splatter effects staining the ground; some environments also depict scattered body parts and corpses amid blood-splattered floors. During the course of the game, players can visit and engage in sexual relations with workers at a brothel\u2014sex acts are not depicted, though sexual moaning is occasionally heard; these encounters sometimes result in characters obtaining various STDs (e.g., syphilis, \u201cDrippy Dragon,\u201d and \u201cCrusty Clam\u201d). The dialogue contains references to drugs (e.g., \u201cIt's giving honest drug dealers like me and Martha a bad name\u201d; \u201cGangsters, raiders, whoremongers, drug dealers, all banded together\u201d); one mission involves collecting mushrooms for an addict. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201cc*nt\u201d appear in the dialogue."
