Made by The Chinese Room -- the studio responsible for the hauntingly beautiful Dear Esther -- this tale of how people respond in the face of grave adversity is a non-linear, open-world experience that pushes innovative interactive storytelling to the next level. This story begins with the end of the world.", 
    "summary": "For the last twelve months, we\u2019ve had our heads down working hard on Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture and it\u2019s really exciting to be able to share some more information with you as well as a new trailer.\n\nIf you already know The Chinese Room, you\u2019ll know that we make story-driven games. Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we\u2019re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it\u2019s also about the end of the world. \n\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There\u2019s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That\u2019s an interesting place to start telling a story.\n\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it\u2019s a character in its own right. It\u2019s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\n\nThe game is all about discovery. It\u2019s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It\u2019s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story \u2013 the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture\u2019s world.",
