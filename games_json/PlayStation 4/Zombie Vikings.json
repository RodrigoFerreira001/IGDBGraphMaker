        "synopsis": "This is a side-scrolling action game in which players control Viking zombies that battle foes and search for a stolen item. Players use swords and clubs to hack and slash at waves of enemy imps, worms, monsters, and occasional human characters. Most enemies disappear into bursts of confetti when defeated; some leave purple stains on the ground. One cutscene depicts a character pulling off its nose, resulting in brief spurts of red blood. The game contains some suggestive material: a character flirting with others as she searches for a boyfriend; a side quest entitled \u201cFind Molgaga a Hot Date\u201d; dialogue such as \"You're sleeping with my brother!\" \"...I prayed with all my heart for beer and sex,\" and \"Was 'clean the cauldron' an innuendo or...\" Several scenes contain instances of crude humor: a level taking place inside a monster's bowels; a boss fight involving a \u201cfish turd cannon\"; a comical depiction of a witch's buttocks; characters emitting flatulence with green gas clouds. During the course of the game, zombies can be seen eating mushrooms, passing out, then discussing \u201ctrippy\u201d effects; dialogue also references the mushrooms' drug-like properties (e.g., \u201cYou also developed a bit of a mushroom addiction. . .You left for mushroom rehab before I could give you\u2026your birthright.\u201d). The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."
