        "synopsis": "This is a survival horror-adventure game in which players assume the role of a man attempting to save his and other children from a network of serial killers. From a pulled-back, top-down view, players explore various areas of Gloomywood collecting items, sneaking around enemies, and helping children to safety. Players can use a variety of weapons (i.e., pistols, bats) to kill enemies; violence is highlighted by gunfire and large blood-splatter effects. Several sequences depict children menaced by killers, and a handful of cutscenes depict these children being beaten, or in one scene, mauled by dogs. One sequence with cannibals features a recipe book with cartoon-like images of children as platters of food; corpses of adults occasionally appear dismembered, or with eyes gouged out. The game includes some sexual material and references (e.g., \u201cRape your mother, kill your father, eat your sister, dismember your brother!\u201d), and a soiled adult magazine item is depicted with a topless figure covering her breasts with her hands. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue."
