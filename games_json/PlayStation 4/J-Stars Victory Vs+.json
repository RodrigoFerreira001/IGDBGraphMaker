        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players compete in a battle tournament with fictional characters from a Manga series. Players punch, kick, and use special attacks (e.g., fireball, lightning strikes, laser blasts) to drain opponents' life meters in melee-style combat. Characters can perform super attacks in which characters are pounded into the ground, attacked by fiery blasts, and repeatedly slashed with swords. Battles are accompanied by colorful light effects, cries of pain, and large explosions. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters wearing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; dialogue that contains suggestive references (e.g., \u201cI don't see any reason for delaying the unveiling of my finely honed physique,\u201d \u201cI'm not embarrassed to show a little skin,\u201d and \u201cIn that case, I'll try to feel ashamed as I walk around naked\u201d). During the course of the game, one character is shown emitting flatulence to perform a jump move; another character is shown poking a pink coil (resembling feces) with a stick. The word \u201ca*s\u201d appears in the game."
