        "synopsis": "This is an action/role-playing game in which players assume the role of an undead character trying to rise through the ranks in the ancient land of Lothric. Players use swords, clubs, lances, and magic arrows to kill creatures (e.g., skeletons, demons, ghouls, zombies) in melee-style and ranged combat. Battles are highlighted by slashing sounds, cries of pain, and large splashes of blood. Some scenes depict characters impaled on swords or lying in large pools of blood. Players can also attack and kill non-combatant characters without penalty. Boss battles depict more prolonged combat, often with large-scale enemies."
