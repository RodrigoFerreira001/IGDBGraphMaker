        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a warrior battling evil forces in different dimensions. Characters use swords, axes, hammers, and magic attacks to kill fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, monsters, dwarfs) and humans in melee-style combat. Cutscenes sometimes depict characters impaled or getting their throats slit. Violent sequences are often highlighted by cries of pain, gurgling/gushing sounds, and large blood-splatter effects; blood remains on the ground in several environments. The game includes some sexual material: a female character briefly depicted in front of a man's torso (fellatio is implied); characters depicted topless or with exposed buttocks while lying in bed or after sex; some dialogue referencing sex/sexuality (e.g., \u201c'I will bring myself sexual pleasure later, while thinking about this with great respect'\u201d and \u201cThe way your t*ts bounce when I pin your arms and take you on the side of the bed\u2026\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."
