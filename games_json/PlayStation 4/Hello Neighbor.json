From a first-person perspective, players sneak into the neighbor's home and solve puzzles to unlock hidden rooms and find objects. Presented in a \"cartoony\" art style, the game includes sequences in which human characters are placed in peril: a boy hiding from attacking mannequins; a boy held captive after getting caught; a neighbor chased by a large shadowy creature; screaming and crashing sounds."
