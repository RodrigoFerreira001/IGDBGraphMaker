        "synopsis": "This is an action-horror game in which players assume the role of Frank West, a photojournalist trapped in a mall overrun by zombies. As players traverse through the mall, they help other survivors to safety and use variety of weapons (e.g., firearms, swords) and tools (e.g., chainsaws, giant drills, lawnmowers) to kill hordes of zombies and, occasionally, humans. Red blood-splatter effects occur frequently as zombies are dismembered and decapitated. Cutscenes also depict intense instances of violence: a clown landing on a pair of chainsaws; a man shooting himself in the head; zombies ripping chunks of flesh off a character's body. During the course of the game, players' character can drink various alcoholic beverages (e.g., wine) to regain energy; players also encounter a drunken character along the way. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d are heard in the dialogue."

He escapes to the local shopping mall thinking it will be a bastion of safety, but it turns out to be anything but. It's a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but with full reign over an entire shopping center, Frank can utilize anything to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.\u00c8", 
    "summary": "\"This action horror game brings new meaning to the phrase \"retail hell.\" Dead Rising uses a dynamic real-time system in which time continues to pass whether Frank is actively engaged or remains stationary. For example, though they move slowly during the day, zombies become stronger and faster when the sun sets and make it even more difficult to survive at night. The unprecedented swarms come in never-ending waves and consist of a diverse population. These former humans retain some memory of their previous lives and it is reflected in their behavior and appearance. The variety of different stores in the mall offers an endless supply of resources including vehicles, makeshift weapons and more. Other survivors are encountered along the way and helping them can provide valuable clues as to what has happened.\"",
