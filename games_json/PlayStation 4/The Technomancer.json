        "synopsis": "\tThis is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a futuristic warrior navigating the cities of Mars. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments (e.g., desert communities, dystopian slums, ice cities), perform various quests, and fight enemy soldiers, thugs, and civilian characters. Characters use staffs and electric attacks to injure and kill human enemies. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and splashes of blood. The game includes some sexual material: prostitutes appearing in some locations while soliciting customers; cutscenes depicting characters (fully clothed) that straddle or caress each other in bed. A handful of missions involve procuring narcotics for others; the dialogue also references drugs (e.g., \u201cI'd love to get my hands of some of that focus drug. I know it's not meant for us, but it gives me a nice buzz\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."
