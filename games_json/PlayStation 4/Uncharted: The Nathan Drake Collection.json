        "synopsis": "This is a compilation of three action-adventure games in which players assume the role of Nathan Drake on various adventures to find lost treasure. As players explore international locations and ancient ruins, they use pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, and grenades to kill various enemies (e.g., mercenaries, soldiers, pirates). Players can also employ melee attacks and stealth takedowns (e.g., choking and neck snapping) to incapacitate enemies. Firefights are highlighted by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, characters engage in suggestive innuendo (e.g., \u201cSo much for foreplay,\u201d \u201cMan interests in climax must be a real hit with the ladies,\u201d and \u201cOh, is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket?\u201d). In one scene, a female character straddles Drake on his bed (both fully clothed) then kisses him before the camera pans away. A handful of sequences also depict characters smoking cigars and/or cigarettes. The word \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cd*ck\u201d are heard in the dialogue."
