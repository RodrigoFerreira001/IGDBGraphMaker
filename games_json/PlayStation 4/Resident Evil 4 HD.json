        "synopsis": "This is a survival-horror action game in which players assume the role of Leon Kennedy as he tries to rescue a character from a mysterious cult. From a third-person perspective, players use pistols, rifles, shotguns, and machine guns to kill infected humans and mutant creatures. Some attacks result in decapitation/dismemberment, which are accompanied by large blood-splatter effects; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled bodies. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a creature tearing a man in half; a character getting decapitated by a chainsaw; a man getting impaled through the chest. The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in the dialogue."
