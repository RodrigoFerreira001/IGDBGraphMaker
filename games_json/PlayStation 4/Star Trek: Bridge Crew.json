From a first-person perspective, players manipulate bridge controls, complete various missions, and battle other ships in space. Battles depict the exchange of phaser/torpedo fire; when the Enterprise takes damage, officers stumble and cry out briefly. Some hits result in officers being electrocuted or knocked unconscious. Enemy ships explode when defeated."

Developed specifically for VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew is the only game to offer a true-to-life level of immersion in the Star Trek universe. \n \nIn Star Trek: Bridge Crew, the Federation dispatches you and your crew to command the new vessel U.S.S. Aegis as part of a critical initiative. Your mission: explore a largely uncharted sector of space known as The Trench, in hopes of locating a suitable new home world for the decimated Vulcan populace. The Trench contains stunning beauty and undiscovered wonders, but also strange anomalies and dangers yet unknown. The Klingon Empire is also active in the region, and their purpose is undoubtedly a threat to the Federation\u2019s plans. It\u2019s up to you and your crew to chart the sector to determine the Klingons\u2019 aims, and to secure a peaceful Federation presence.",
