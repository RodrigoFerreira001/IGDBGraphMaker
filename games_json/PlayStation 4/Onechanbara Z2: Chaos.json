        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players control two sets of sisters as they battle zombies, demons, ghouls, and werewolves in order to save the world. Players use swords, chainsaws, and energy blasts to kill enemies and boss characters in frenetic melee-style combat. Players can use weapons to dismember enemies' limbs and/or cut their bodies in half, resulting in large blood-splatter effects and strewn body parts. Finishing moves depict dramatic slashing and stabbing in slow-motion. During the course of the game, some female characters wear outfits (e.g., bikinis, thongs) that expose large amounts of cleavage and buttocks. Some costumes depict paint and/or fruit that barely cover characters' breasts and genitalia; cutscenes also depict characters' jiggling breasts and close-up angles of buttocks. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue."

Compared to the earlier Onechanbara games, Onechanbara Z2: Chaos is faster paced. Aya, Kagura, Saya, and Saki fight alongside each other in the game. You can switch between characters on the fly and set up two character combos called Cross Merge Combinations. All of the girls can temporarily transform by triggering a Dear Drive and to finally execute enemies you do a series of swipes using the PS4\u2032s touch panel.",
