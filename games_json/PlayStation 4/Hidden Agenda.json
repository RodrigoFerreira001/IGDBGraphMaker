        "synopsis": "\tThis is an action game in which players follow the story of a police detective as she tracks down a serial killer. As the story unfolds, players can vote for specific decisions and engage in various mini-games (i.e., quick-time events) to influence the narrative. Some decisions and actions can lead to various acts of violence: a man shot in the shoulder; a woman electrocuted; a character killed in an explosion. In one sequence, a character cuts open a man's stomach off-screen, removing an object from his body. One crime scene depicts a murder victim in a large pool of blood. The game contains several references to prostitution in the dialogue (e.g., \u201c...brought a prostitute\u201d and \u201cMet with a hooker...\") and implications of child molestation (e.g., \"...running the orphanage....The 'Playroom.' Well that was what he called it, but I think he was the only one having any fun in there.\u201d). Depictions of call-girl posters and pictures can be seen in one area. Dialogue also references drugs (e.g., \u201c...I found drugs. I was high the moment I got out of there.\u201d). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the game."
