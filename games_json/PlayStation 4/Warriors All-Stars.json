        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players control characters from several Koei Tecmo properties to battle an evil entity. As players navigate battlefields from a third-person perspective, they engage in hack-and-slash combat with hordes of enemies (e.g., monsters, blob-like creatures, humanoids). Characters use swords, guns, spears, traps, and magical attacks to defeat enemies. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain, slow-motion sequences, and impact sounds. Some female characters wear low-cut tops that expose large amounts of cleavage; the camera occasionally lingers or pans slowly over characters' body parts. Some movements cause characters' breasts to jiggle. During the course of the game, characters reference alcohol in the dialogue (e.g., \"Your love of distilled liquor is well known even in my time\"; \"I've got some Texan wine you can have\"; \"And the sake will taste better as well.\").

The King who controlled the power of the Spring had suddenly died, and at the same time, the Spring had dried up. \n \nIn order to save their dying world, the Queen tells her daughter of an old prophecy: \n \n\"When the Spring loses its power and the world heads for destruction, Heroes from other worlds shall arrive. The Heroes will share their power with the shrines and revive the Spring. And the one who leads the Heroes will be crowned as the new Monarch, and restore glory to the world.\" \n \nFollowing the words of her mother, Princess Tamaki tries to perform the ceremony to call for heroes from different worlds. \nHowever, something goes wrong, and the heroes end up scattered across the land. \n \nAnd then\u2026 \n \nBefore each of these displaced and bewildered heroes, strangers appear, asking for their aid. \n \nIt is not only Tamaki who seeks the aid of the heroes. There are tree scions of the royal family, who all have their reasons for aiming to take the throne. \n \nEventually, the heroes are split into three separate groups, forced to fight on opposing sides...\"", 
    "summary": "Musou Stars, released as Warriors All-Stars internationally, is a crossover game that features characters from multiple Koei Tecmo published franchises and games. \n \nAlong with some original characters the game features characters, maps and enemies from multiple games/series's including: Atelier, Dead or Alive, Deception, Dynasty Warriors, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de, Ninja Gaiden, Opoona, Samurai Warriors, Toukiden, and Nioh. \n \n\"Warriors All-Stars not only features an extensive battle system, but also an abundance of content for players to enjoy outside of combat! This includes the Sanctuary, which surrounds the game\u2019s mighty Hot Springs. Within, players are able to take a break from the heat of battle to upgrade their Hero Cards and work on clan member relations by visiting the Sanctuary\u2019s many locations \u2013 the Tavern, Inn, Refinery, Practice Arena and Headquarters. The Tavern and Inn are where many heroes can be found participating in their favorite activities, whether they\u2019re spending time with friends or having a relaxing bath in the Hot Springs. As bonds between comrades strengthen, players are rewarded with unique cutscenes at the Sanctuary, providing a deeper insight into each character\u2019s backstory. \n \nStopping by the Refinery lets players enhance, create and sell Hero Cards found on the battlefield. Hero Cards are mystical objects that provide new skills and boost the abilities of the character they\u2019re equipped on. And at the Practice Arena, Warriors can improve their stats by exchanging their hard-earned gold for experience points. Once players feel rejuvenated and ready to get back to the action, they can visit the Headquarters to accept missions for their clan and plot their next course of action on the World Map!\"",
