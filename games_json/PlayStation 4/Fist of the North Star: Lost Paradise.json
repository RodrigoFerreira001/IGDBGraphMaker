In an era in which civilization has been destroyed and nothing is created anymore, strong men struggle to conquer what little food and resources are left. It was a world dominated by violence. Yet, in a corner of that world, there was a place called \u201cthe city of miracles,\u201d a city named \u201cEden.\u201d \n \nEden receives energy and water from a giant dome-shaped relic of the old world named \u201cSphere City,\u201d and there is even an entertainment district. Citizen lived a comfortable life that others in this era can\u2019t even imagine. \n \nOne day a man named Kenshiro reaches Eden at the end of his wanderings. He was the successor of Hokuto Shinken, an ancient assassination art passed down from a single line of successors. The heart of this man, thought invincible, was instead filled with despair. His only hope was a rumor indicating that his long lost fiancee Yuria that he thought dead, was instead alive and in Eden. \n \nHowever, Eden is closed to outsider, and the gates block Kenshiro\u2019s way. What will he have to do to enter Eden? And what destiny awaits in his pursuit of Yuria? \n \nKenshiro is a man who follows his love in a mysterious city, caught in the river of fate. A new legend of the savior begins.",
