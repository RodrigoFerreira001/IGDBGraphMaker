        "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Kyle Crane, a soldier of fortune sent to battle zombies. Players can traverse the open-world environment and attack hordes of zombies to complete mission objectives. Players use axes, machetes, rifles and tools (e.g., firecrackers and Molotov cocktails) to kill enemies in frenetic melee-style combat. Red blood-splatter effects occur frequently; large blood stains can be seen in the environment. Enemies often get dismembered and decapitated during combat; a handful of sequences depict mutilated bodies with exposed organs/viscera. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue. "
