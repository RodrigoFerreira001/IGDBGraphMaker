    "summary": "Defenders adds two new modes, Protector and Commando, a smaller local co-op mode called Battle Mode, new Challenges and trophies.\n\nProtector Mode sees you taking to the skies to defend one of the last human colonies remaining. Utilise all new power ups including Super Boost, Teleport and automatic city defences; take down the enemy and deliver as many of the last humans to each city in order to extend your grip on the planet. Protector Mode features an all new planet flip mechanic and environmental hazards such as volcanic meteors to avoid while fighting off the never ending enemy invasion.\n\nCommando Mode lets you play as one of the Last Humans. Stranded on a distant planet with only a mini-gun to defend himself, he takes the fight directly to the Sentients in the ultimate arcade revenge mode. Jump, boost and equip your favourite bandana as you aim to defend your home from waves of enemies, volcanic meteors and more in this all new mode. Arnold impression included.\n\nCommando Mode supports both co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. Team up with a friend to fight the good fight or turn against each other to outsmart your opponent and destroy their house from under their nose. We\u2019ve named the competitive mode Battle Mode and hope you have as much fun fighting it out with your friends as we have had here.\n\nRESOGUN Defenders includes an all new trophy set and new DLC-specific Challenges.",
