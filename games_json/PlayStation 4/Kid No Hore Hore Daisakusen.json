    "summary": "Before the SNES adaptation, Nichibitsu had actually licensed the Heiankyo Alien game in order to create its Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen series. Although it features hole digging/enemy trapping mechanic, it's hardly the trap-'em-up that Heiankyo Alien is. The real goal of each level is to collect all the items available to exit the level through a door. With the use of other items such as flame throwers and bombs, you could play through the entire game without once trapping an enemy. The game had several sequels, including Booby Kids for the Famicom and Doraemon Meiky\u016b Daisakusen for the PC Engine. The latter was localized and released on the TurboGrafx-16 under the title Cratermaze, with the Doraemon character removed.",
