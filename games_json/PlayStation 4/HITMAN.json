        "synopsis": "This is a stealth action game in which players control Agent 47, an assassin tasked with eliminating targets throughout various missions. From a third-person perspective, players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and various tools (e.g., poisons, cleavers, explosives) to assassinate human characters. Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., strangling characters with wires) to eliminate targets and guards at close range. Players have the ability to kill non-adversary characters (e.g., striking them with an ax, shooting them in plain sight), though this may negatively affect players' progress and points. Large blood-splatter effects often occur, and pools of blood appear under victims' bodies. During the course of the game, some female characters are seen unconscious and dragged by players' character; their underwear and portions of their buttocks are sometimes depicted. The dialogue also contains suggestive material (e.g., \"Go get yourself laid or something,\" \"I'm a wh*re,\" and \"...move your pelvis back and forth and in and out.\"). There are also brief references to drugs in dialogue (e.g., \u201cHe's probably coked out of his mind\u201d and \u201cYou don't have any coke, do you?\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201cc*ck\u201d are heard in dialogue."

    "summary": "Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill \u2013 it is all up to you. \n \nHITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st. \n \nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode. \n \nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You\u2019ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that\u2019s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return. \n \nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You\u2019ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It\u2019s more about being playful than realistic. \n \nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you\u2019ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",
