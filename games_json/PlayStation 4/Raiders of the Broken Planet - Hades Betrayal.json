    "summary": "\"General Krausher, head of the Hades Division, isn\u2019t a complicated guy. Those who know him say that Krausher has a single fear in life: that his enemies have a bigger one than he does. How Krausher applies this principle to the current conflict is known to a select few, including his faithful Lieutenant Ayana Kwena. If the Raiders are going to have any chance of defeating Krausher, it will be by convincing Ayana to betray him and change sides. And no, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t look like a very good plan.\"",
