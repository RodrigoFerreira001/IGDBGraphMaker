The Colonials have countered all of the Cylon\u2019s offensives so far, but no decisive victory was achieved. \n \nThe deadlock is suddenly broken by a surprise attack from the Cylons and the brutal annihilation of the Colonial Fleet High Command on Picon. The fate of mankind is now resting on the shoulders of Rear-Admiral Lucinda Cain. \n \nThe secret, cunning plan she has conceived could turn the tide of the war forever\u2026",
