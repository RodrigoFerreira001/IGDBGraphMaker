        "synopsis": "This is a flight simulation game in which players pilot realistic war planes in combat missions during the Vietnam War. Players participate in dogfights, bombing raids, and other aerial missions, using machine guns and bombs to destroy enemy aircraft and ground targets. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire and fiery plane crashes. Some missions allow players to use a machine gun turret (from a first-person perspective) to shoot and kill numerous enemy soldiers on the ground; brief blood-splatter effects are depicted. Accompanying language and song lyrics contain words such as \"bastard,\" drug references (e.g., \u201cThe pin and the tin may be all I might ever need\u201d and \u201cChase that tail go take a toke\u201d), and suggestive themes (e.g., \"come on you know you want it/just lay back and relax/cuz it'll go a lot faster/if you stop fighting back.\")."
