Not to mention there are Wardog detachments looking for him to take him out. Loaht should have never betrayed General Marmalade, a former drug trafficker turned Wardog messiah and unrepentant Aleph addict. The General takes no prisoners. He wants all the Aleph from the Broken Planet for himself, and he\u2019s not far from achieving his goal. The way things are now, the wrath of Loaht could be the Raiders\u2019 only hope. If they find him alive...\"",
