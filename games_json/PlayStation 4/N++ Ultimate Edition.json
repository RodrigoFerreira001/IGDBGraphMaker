    "summary": "\"N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer where you get to play as a badass parkour-loving ninja, narrowly escaping enemies and collecting gold in sci-fi landscapes. \n \nWhat's new in the Ultimate Edition? So much. 60 dynamic new colour schemes, new ninja headbands, new secrets and more. The Ultimate Edition doubles the size of N++, bringing the total to 4340 hand-crafted, finely tuned levels in 3 game modes: Solo, Co-op and Race. It also adds a new mode, Hardcore, which changes the rules of the game and lets you see Solo in a whole new light. Hardcore mode is a true challenge for Ultimate ninjas! And it's completely free -- this update means the game could last a lifetime. N++ is truly the last platformer you'll ever need to buy!\"",
