Players engage in a variety of missions, using swords and guns to defeat enemies (e.g., aliens, zombies, boss characters) in fast-paced combat. Battles are highlighted by screen-shaking effects, impact sounds, and cries of pain. Enemies generally break apart into pieces when defeated. A title screen depicts wounded/dead soldiers with blood on their armor. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in the game text."

The E.B.E. moved across the planet like a plague of locusts, consuming anything in their path and wiping out most of humanity. All attempts to fight back were futile, as the E.B.E. appeared to be resilient to every kind of weapon that mankind could offer. \n \nAt the last moment a breakthrough was made: by using weaponry crafted from the E.B.E\u2019s own technology, a weakness was discovered that could be exploited. Bionic implants were quickly developed and implanted into the most superior forces left alive, creating super soldiers capable of taking the fight to the E.B.E. A plan was devised and the objective was clear: retake Earth at all costs and drive the E.B.E. to the edge of extinction as they had once us.\"", 
    "summary": "\"Developed by OneorEight and previously released in Japan under the name Earth Wars, \"Earth\u2019s Dawn\" fuses frenetic side-scrolling action mechanics with RPG elements and a hard-edged manga aesthetic to deliver a deep and unique gameplay experience. \n \nFrom the outset Earth\u2019s Dawn gives gamers the freedom to enjoy the game their way \u2013 from creating their own character; customization of skill trees to augment abilities best suited to play style; weapon and equipment crafting; alongside a unique narrative-driven branching mission system.\"",
