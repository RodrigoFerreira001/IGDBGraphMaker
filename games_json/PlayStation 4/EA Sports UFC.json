        "synopsis": "This is a mixed martial arts simulation game in which players fight against other real-world opponents in UFC-style matches. Players can use martial arts, wrestling, boxing, and grappling moves to cause opponents to lose consciousness or \u201ctap out\u201d from choke holds, arm pins, leg bends). Repeated punching and kicking moves can cause cuts and bruises on opponents and leave blood stains on the mat. The game also contains live-action footage that depicts fighters punching and kicking each other, as well as ground and pound (i.e., punching opponents repeatedly while they are pinned to the mat); some fighters appear bloodied. During gameplay, ring girls wear revealing outfits (e.g., tight short shorts and tops), as crowd members whistle/catcall. The words \u201ca*s,\u201d 'damn,' and 'hell' can be heard in the dialogue"
