        "synopsis": "\tThis is a role-playing game in which players control a group of young fighters as they try to save the world from evil forces. As players explore game environments, they engage in turn-based battles with fantastical creatures (e.g., giant insects, werewolves). Characters use swords, pistols, and magic attacks to deplete enemies' hit points; enemies fall to the ground and disappear when defeated. Cutscenes sometimes depict characters with blood on their faces or clothes; one scene depicts a wounded character lying in a pool of blood. The game contains some suggestive dialogue, including several references to breast size: \u201cIt's time to join the battle for boob supremacy\u201d; \u201cSo you do all your action scenes with everything hanging out like that?\u201d; \u201cI mean, Yui's pretty stacked!\u201d A bathhouse sequence (unseen) contains innuendo about men touching and caressing each other (e.g., \"It's so soft. Look at how slippery it is!\"). The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in dialogue."
