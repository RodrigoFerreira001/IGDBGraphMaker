        "synopsis": "This is a strategy role-playing game in which players follow the story of a masked figure battling imperial forces in a fantasy kingdom. From an overhead perspective, players interact with characters and engage in turn-based battles against enemy soldiers. Characters use swords, staffs, and magic spells to attack enemies; damage is indicated by impact sounds and light effects. A few cutscenes depict blood-splatter effects as characters are attacked by monsters; some sequences depict blood that briefly stains the player's screen. The game contains some sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., \u201cIt makes you want to do sexual things! Lewd things! S-So, that means it's...an aphrodisiac...\u201d; \u201cWe are Master's personal vixens to mate with as he pleases\u201d; and \u201cI guess someone might be able to see this as an erotic sight...\u201d). In one card-game sequence, a character is depicted in varying stages of undress; eventually she is depicted nude, though her limbs and objects obscure her nipples/genitalia. A bathhouse sequence also depicts partial nudity (i.e., steam/soap bubbles cover characters' nipples/genitalia.). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in dialogue."
