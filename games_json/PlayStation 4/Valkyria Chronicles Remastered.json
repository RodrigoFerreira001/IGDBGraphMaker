        "synopsis": "This is a turn-based tactical role-playing game (RPG) in which players control infantry and armored units in warfare against an invading enemy force. Battles are depicted mostly from a third-person perspective as players perform various actions such as firing weapons (guns, grenades, cannons, flamethrowers), using healing items, claiming flag points, and moving tanks along city streets. Several interspersed cutscenes depict characters being shot and killed and sometimes include small splashes of pixilated red blood. One sequence involves female characters wearing and discussing \"racy\" bathing suits, while the camera pans and lingers on certain body parts. A handful of cutscenes depict a character smoking a cigarette. "

    "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 in 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11, 2014. A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10, 2016 with a Western release planned for May 2016. Both PC and PS4 versions include previously released DLC.\n\nThe game is set in fictional Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game's visuals, which use Sega's CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion.",
