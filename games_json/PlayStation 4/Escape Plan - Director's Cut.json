    "summary": "Cut! That\u2019s a wrap. We present to you the Escape Plan Director\u2019s Cut DLC. Work your way through the most evil, heart-wrenching, explosive levels the designers of Escape Plan ever conceived. The Director's Cut is so twisted it puts Bakuki to shame, as this DLC truly puts the most avid Escape Plan fans to the test. In this latest set of puzzles, players will get to explore some of the game designers' favorite radical environments which weren't a part of the original game, along with a handful of new locales created just for this fancy DLC.\n\nDirector\u2019s Cut adds loads of new content with a full set of 21 levels to add to the gripping tale of Lil and Laarg, which pushes the entire available content of Escape Plan with all the DLC packs to a whopping 150+ levels! This DLC also includes Dressing Room costumes: Lost Clause, Timeless, I\u2019m with Cupid, and Halloweeners. We are also introducing 4 shiny Trophies, and even more new Challenges!",
