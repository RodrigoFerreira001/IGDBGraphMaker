Inside the Egg lied Yin and Yang, ready to fuse with it to create the First Human, and with him, the first universe. \n \nBut Chaos didn\u2019t wanted a change, so it broke the Egg, removing Yin and Yang from within and cast them away as far as it could. Fortunately, they crashed in the Land of Wood. \n \nTaking on new forms, Yin and Yang swore themselves to cross the elements, find their Guardians and go as far as they can to reach the Egg before it ceases to exist, and let only Chaos remain.",
