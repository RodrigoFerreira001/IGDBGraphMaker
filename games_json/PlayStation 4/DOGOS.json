A group of\nhumans organize themselves to resist the invasion, but soon discover they don\u2019t stand any chance against the enemy\u2019s\ntechnological superiority. The Resistance decides to embark on an ambitious project: combining human and alien engineering, they set out to create a fleet of ships to fight the invaders.\n\nThe Zeetnuks uncover the Resistance\u2019s plans and they launch a surprise attack against the base where the humans are developing the prototypes. During the attack, Desmond Phoenix, a skilled pilot, manages to escape on a KZ 72\u2014one of the models being developed, which everyone will come to know as DOGOS.\n\nDOGOS tells the story of that pilot, and how his actions changed the future of the human race.",
