The game is set to release in 2015. \n \nSeveral years after the events of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Nathan Drake, who retired as a fortune hunter, will embark on a globe-trotting journey in pursuit of a historical conspiracy behind a fabled pirate treasure. Naughty Dog outlined the game's plot as \"his greatest adventure yet and will test his physical limits, his resolve, and ultimately what he's willing to sacrifice to save the ones he loves\".",
