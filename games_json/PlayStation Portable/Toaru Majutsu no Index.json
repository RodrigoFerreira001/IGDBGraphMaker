As with many fighting games, players choose a characters from a lineup, and engage in hand-to-hand combat with an opponent. It is primarily a competitive two player series, but a human player can fight an AI-controlled character for practice, amusement, or to advance the game's story. In the game the player has the option of using a partner to be used as support during the match. All the characters can be used as partners, however, both Index and Last Order are exclusively partner-type characters, and can't be used for fighting.",
