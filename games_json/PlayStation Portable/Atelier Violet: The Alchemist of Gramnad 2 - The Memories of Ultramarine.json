The main protagnoist Violet lives there with her family, although her parents are leaving Karotte Village. Violet, however, refuses to leave. Violet is very confident about her idea to open up a shop in town, even though her father doesn't support her idea. Their parents will return in three years, and see how the siblings are doing. Until then, Violet will need to prove that she can run her own shop.",
