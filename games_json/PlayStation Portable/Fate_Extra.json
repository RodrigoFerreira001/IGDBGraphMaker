        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players control human characters (i.e., Masters) who enter a tournament-war to win a mythical prize. As players explore fantasy environments and interact with characters, they use swords and magical projectiles to engage in turn-based combat with various enemies (e.g., insect-like monsters, cube-shaped creatures, and other Masters); battles are accompanied by colorful explosions, slow-motion effects, and a loss of hit points as opponents' health meters are depleted. During the course of the game, some dialogue includes sexual references and/or innuendo (e.g., \u201cMmm, her torpedo ta-tas . . . The power of boobs compelled me,\u201d \u201cMy manhood grows in direct proportion to the number of sodas down the hatch,\u201d and \u201cWhy is it that the beds in the nurse's office kind of make me think dirty thoughts?\u201d). One scene includes a reference to the 'drug trade'; the words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cb*tch,\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in dialogue."

    "summary": "Fate/Extra is a dungeon crawl style Japanese role-playing game. The game takes place in a parallel universe to the visual novel Fate/stay night. At the start of the game, the player may choose to play as either a male or female character, as well as selecting one of three Servants \u2014 Saber, Archer, or Caster, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Players spend one ingame \"week\" interacting with other characters, viewing scenes that advance the game's story, talking to their Servant in their room, and gathering clues to the identity of the enemy Servant. At the end of each day, they enter the Arena, a dungeon in which they can battle monsters to gain experience points and strengthen their Servant. The game's turn-based battle system is comparable to rock-paper-scissors -- \"Attack\" overpowers \"Break\", Break overpowers \"Guard\", and Guard overpowers Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves at the beginning of each turn.",
