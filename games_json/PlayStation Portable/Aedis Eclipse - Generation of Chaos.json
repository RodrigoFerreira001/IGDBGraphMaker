    "summary": "The second Generation of Chaos strategy title on PSP (based on GoC V on PS2) takes place in this world divided into three warring planes. Each world has its own main character and story; therefore, players can experience three different stories at once. Depending on which world the player begins with, the difficulty level will differ. The lower world is regarded as the beginner's stage with many tutorials to guide the player through the game. The higher the world you choose to play with, the more difficult it becomes. Battle in each mode using a combination of incredible team customization and item crafting in a multi-unit battle system, with a focus on fast-loading and constant battles to give players a nearly seamless RPG experience.",
