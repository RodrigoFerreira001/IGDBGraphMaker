    "summary": "Monster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village is a spin-off installment in the Monster Hunter series, developed by FromSoftware and published by Capcom for the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fc air\u016b) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them. One episode also has a Chibiterasu cameo. \n \nA Nintendo 3DS version of the game, titled Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village DX was developed and released in Japan on September 10, 2015",
