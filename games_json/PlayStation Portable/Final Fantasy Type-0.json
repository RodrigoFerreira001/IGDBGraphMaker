The gameplay is reminiscent of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, with the player taking direct control of characters and taking them on missions and large-scale battles. \n \nThe game focuses on the stories of Class Zero, a group of twelve magic-endowed students from the Peristylium, a magical academy in the country of Suzaku. One day, the Milites Empire launches an assault on the other nations of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals. When Suzaku is attacked, Class Zero are called into action and become entangled in both the efforts to push back and defeat the forces of Milites, and reveal the secret behind the war and the existence of the crystals.",
