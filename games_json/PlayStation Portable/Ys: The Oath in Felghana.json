        "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players perfrom quests and follow a storyline about an adventurer (Adol Christin) in the fantastical land of Felghana. From a \u00be\u2013overhead perspective, players run and jump through levels and use swords and magic spells to destroy enemy soldiers and creatures (e.g., fairies, giant insects, skeleton warriors). Small puffs of blood appear when players attack enemies, and some creatures break into pieces and disappear in bursts of light when defeated. During one extended cutscene, an argument ends with one character getting stabbed in the chest and collapsing in a pool of blood. Some female characters wear revealing outfits; for example, one gallery image depicts a bluish humanoid creature whose breasts are partially covered by feathers and jewelry. During the storyline sequences, dialogue sometimes contains suggestive innuendo (e.g., \"She sure has filled out nicely . . . she's got that whole childhood friend thing goin' for her, too!\"). Language such as \"bastard,\" \"dumba*s,\" and \"b*tch\" can also be heard in dialogue."

Hordes of violent monsters roam the outskirts of town, a long-dormant volcano has suddenly sprung back to life and the new lord of the land has begun mercilessly and inexplicably extorting money from its long-suffering citizens. While Dogi seeks out his former combat master for answers, Adol tends to the townsfolk -- and finds himself embroiled in a world of political conspiracies, ancient legacies and unthinkable taboos.",
