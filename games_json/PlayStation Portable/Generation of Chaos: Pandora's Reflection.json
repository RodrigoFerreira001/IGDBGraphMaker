    "summary": "The sixth game in Idea Factory's strategy RPG saga, Generation of Chaos: Pandora's Reflection features an active-time battle system, in which players can move and position their units in real-time across sweeping battlefields -- you'll need a quick mind and a steady hand to succeed! \nDark clouds blanket the withered skies and block out the sun; cracked earth and choking fog rule the land. This colorless world, showing no signs of life, is known as Hades. The barren land is blasted by chilling winds that cut to the bone ... This is where we meet our heroes -- Yuri, a young girl cursed with a disease draining her life away; and Claude, her protective older brother who will stop at nothing to save her. As they travel in search of a cure, they find themselves embroiled in a conflict that will determine the fate of the world and, just maybe, the fate of the siblings. They'll lose old friends, meet new friends, and travel on a path that will lead them to the very doorstep of destiny...",
