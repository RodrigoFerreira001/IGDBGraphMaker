Players use a transformable sword/gun/shield to engage in melee-style battles with fantastical creatures; combat is highlighted by large sprays of blood that quickly disappear. In one sequence, players' character uses a sword to slice into a dragon-like monster's neck. Some females are depicted in outfits that expose moderate amounts of cleavage; one cutscene depicts a woman briefly clasping the breasts of another female character. A handful of cutscenes depict characters smoking cigarettes or drinking from cans of beer. The words 'sh*t' and 'bastard' appear in the dialogue."
