Some female avatars have tight bodysuits that depict moderate cleavage, and one line judge is described as \"the seductive superlady\" with a profile that asks, \"How long before the court is mobbed by men wanting to steal a look?\" During matches it is possible for the tennis ball to hit people outside the court (dog walkers, spectators, etc.), and in one scene a character is comically thrown out of a temple."
