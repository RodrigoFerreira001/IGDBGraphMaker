    "summary": "Judith Volltone is living alone in the alchemy shop that she inherited from her parents. She specializes in making medication, and often takes requests from villagers to make a living. \n \nOne day, an adventurer requests her to create an item called the \"Hourglass of the Dragon\", which has the abilities to travel in time. While synthesizing it, a piece of Judith's hair falls down into the cauldron, and Judith suddenly finds herself 200 years into the future.",
