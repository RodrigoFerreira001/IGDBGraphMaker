        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one combat with a large cast of human, animal, and supernatural characters. Players use martial arts punches, kicks, and throws to drain their opponents' life meters. Some characters supplement traditional hand-to-hand combat with weapons (guns, bats, swords, rocket launchers, etc.); other characters can summon more fantastical attacks, including laser beams that shoot from their eyes; chainsaws attached to arms; a flatulence attack stronger than the average bear's; and an assortment of \"Drunken\" attacks (\"Drunken Tiger Kick, \"Drunken Master Walk,\" \"Drunken Rapid Fists,\" \"Drunken Fox Combination,\" etc.). It is probably no coincidence that the fighter who performs the Drunken Master Walk will wobble, lurch, and lose his balance as he fights.\r\n\r\nPlayers can access a wide range of customizable accessories for their characters; some of these items include outfits that expose portions of female fighters' lower breasts and buttocks. During a few cutscenes (where graphics tend to be enhanced), the camera briefly pans on their thighs, breasts, and buttocks; and during battle, when a female character is struck by an attack, her breasts will sometimes bounce. (There are no comparable physics applied to male characters.) The majority of cutscenes (including those above) introduce elements of irreverence and comic relief, though one sketch might be difficult to digest: pizza, laxatives\u2014flatulence. The dialogue contains the expletives \"a*s,\" \"bastard,\" \"damn,\" and \"b*tch\"; it may also contain a line expressed by one of its feisty female characters\u2014Asuka Kazama: \"If you're not gonna take me seriously, then I'll just have to give you a serious a*s-kicking.\""

Mirroring his father's previous leadership, Jin uses the company's resources to become a global superpower, severs the national's ties and openly declares war against all nations over the following year. This action plunges the world into an extremely chaotic spiral, with a huge-scale civil war erupting around the globe and even amidst the space colonies orbiting the planet. Meanwhile, his father, Kazuya Mishima has risen as the leader of Mishima Zaibatsu's rival company, G Corporation, following his assassinations of the company's high officials for his attempted murder beforehand. Kazuya views Jin's actions to be a nuisance in his own plans and becomes the only one who can directly oppose Jin's control. He places a bounty on Jin's head for anyone who can capture him. Jin then announces the sixth King of Iron Fist Tournament, sparking many people into entering the tournament to defeat him.",
