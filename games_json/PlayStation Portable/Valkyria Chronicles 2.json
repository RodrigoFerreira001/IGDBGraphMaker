        "synopsis": "This is a tactical role-playing game in which players control infantry and armored units in warfare against invading enemy forces. Battles are depicted from a third-person perspective as players fire weapons (e.g., rifles, grenades), use healing or other support items, claim flag points, and move tanks and personnel along city streets. Short, cutscenes depict characters being killed, occasionally with small splashes of blood; and one cell-shaded cutscene depicts a young girl sitting between her dead parents amid small pools of blood. Some scenes portray suggestive behavior, including a pool scene in which a female character with large, bouncing breasts loses her bikini top off screen (e.g., \"Seriously nice form\" and \"Y-You lecherous pigs! Stop staring!\"). Another scene depicts an accidental groping of a woman's chest. Words such as \"damn\" and \"hell\" can be heard in the dialogue."

A rebel group made up of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army rises up in arms in order to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent. However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia's regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.\"", 
    "summary": "Sequel to \"Valkyria Chronicles\" for the PS3. \nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes. It also changes the battle system to include multiple map areas that are unlocked as you take over enemy bases revealing more of the battlefield and allowing you to call units into that area.",
