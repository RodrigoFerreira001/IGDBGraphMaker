In this world, dragons control both nature and the climate; therefor they are worshipped by human beings and humanoids as the gaurdians of the world, and protected by those known as Dragoneers. When a black dragon suddenly appears and starts to destroy the land, it's up to one young dragoneer to stop it with the help of his friends.",
