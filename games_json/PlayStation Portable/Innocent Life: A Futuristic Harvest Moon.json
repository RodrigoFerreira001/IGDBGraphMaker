    "summary": "Life is good for the residents of Heartflame Island, especially since new robots and automated machines do almost all of the work. But technology is a tool--not an answer to all problems. Maybe that's why everyone is a little uneasy about the old stories of strange magic and a prediction that Flame Mountain will erupt and destroy everything. That's why Dr. Hope, a caring and wise old scholar has sent you, his son on a journey to the ancient ruins to try and run a farm. It is your father's dream that you will unlock the secrets of the ancient ruins and find the meaning of \"life\".",
