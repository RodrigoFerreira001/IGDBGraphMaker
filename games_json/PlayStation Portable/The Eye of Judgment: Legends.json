All the action takes place on the PSP itself, so there's no need for extra peripherals such as a camera or physical cards, making this a fun and accessible game for players of all skill levels. The Eye of Judgement: Portable features a brand new single player story created exclusively for the PSP version, which challenges you to defeat rival characters while traveling around the magical EOJ world. Battles take place using digital on-screen cards, and as the adventure progresses, players can acquire new abilities by building their digital card collection. The ultimate goal is to obtain sufficient cards and special powers to confront and defeat Scion, Biolith Lord in a final showdown.",
