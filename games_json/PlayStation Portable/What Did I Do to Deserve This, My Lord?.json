    "summary": "The goal of the game is clean and simple: As the God of Destruction, you must create a dungeon that is difficult and powerful enough to fend off human hero invasions. The dungeon must have a self-sustaining ecosystem, so players must strategically dig and create a dungeon with a balanced food chain. Periodically, human heroes will invade the dungeon in order to bring peace and harmony to the world, but they are your enemies. You must destroy the heroes before they capture the Overlord and take him back to the surface.\n\nAs a critically acclaimed strategy game in Japan, Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! features a retro-classic art style and simple yet intuitive gameplay.",
