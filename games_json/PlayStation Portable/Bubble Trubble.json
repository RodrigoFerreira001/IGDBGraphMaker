    "summary": "Bubble Trubble is a dynamic new twist to falling puzzle games that lets players rotate and drop clusters of colored bubbles, matching colors to fuse them together and grow them until they burst. Be sure to combine matched colored bubbles together before running out of room. To avoid any trubble, you've gotta burst your Bubble! Three zany cartoon animal guides react to players performances as they present each level and its unique environment's challenge. Be sure to watch out for the Power Bubbles that may enhance or impede your performance.",
