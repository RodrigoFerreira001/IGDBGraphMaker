    "summary": "Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a Spider-Man video game based on the comic book series and Spider-Man movies. The game was released on October 2, 2007.[1] \n \nSpider-Man: Friend or Foe was originally announced via a promotional page on the back of the Spider-Man 3 video game instruction booklet. The teaser stated that the game would be a \"A new twist on the legend. A new take on the movies.\" The game's website shows a few screenshots of the game and the Green Goblin makes an appearance.[1] The game has a very different engine and style as compared to the previous official film tie-ins. \n \nAccording to the company report, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe is a unique take on the media franchise. Inspired by the movies Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3, this action/adventure beat 'em up game reinterprets big-screen moments and battles with a humorous twist. Players team up with famous heroes from the Marvel Comics universe to combat villains and then convert them to sidekicks after defeating them in epic boss battles.[2] The game includes a co-op multiplayer mode, as Spider-Man or a sidekick, in locations around the globe, including Tokyo, Egypt, and Nepal.[3] \n \nSpider-Man: Friend or Foe, along with most other games published by Activision that had used the Marvel licence, was de-listed and removed from all digital storefronts on January 1, 2014.[4][5]",
