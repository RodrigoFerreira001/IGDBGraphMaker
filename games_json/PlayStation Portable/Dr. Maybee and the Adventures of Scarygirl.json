    "summary": "Based on the Scarygirl graphic novel created by acclaimed artist Nathan Jurevicius, Dr Maybee and the Adventures of Scarygirl is a marvelous adventure through the Scarygirl universe, as she attempts to discover the identity of the mysterious, bearded man haunting her dreams. With help from her friends, the quick-witted Bunniguru and Blister the giant octopus, she will journey from her treehouse home in the forest to an overwhelmingly unfriendly city in her quest to locate Dr Maybee. \nFeatures \nSurreal Art by Nathan Jurevicius: Scarygirl's fantastic landscape and creatures are both beautiful and bizarre to behold \nScarygirl & Friends: Calling them a \u2018colorful\u2019 cast of characters would be an understatement. Scarygirl, the part-octopus girl who dresses like a pirate, has a tentacle for her right hand and has naught but a bone for her left, is the star here, though each friendly or treacherous creature she meets will certainly be unique \nIt's a Completist's Paradise: In each level, players can search high and low for hundreds of gems, fish, and other items to collect.",
