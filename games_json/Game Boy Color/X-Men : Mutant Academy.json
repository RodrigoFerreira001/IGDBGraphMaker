    "summary": "X-Men: Mutant Academy is a 3-D/2D fighting game developed by Paradox, the company behind Activision's Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style and the never-published Thrill Kill, and based on X-Men characters, from Marvel Comics. The game was released for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation as a tie-in to X-Men. \n \nX-Men: Mutant Academy is a basic fighting game that uses six buttons: three buttons for punches and three for kicks. Due to the success of the game, it was followed by two sequels: X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 and X-Men: Next Dimension. The game's characters can be played both with their comic book costumes and their costumes from the 2000 film X-Men. Characters not present in the film were given costumes of a similar design.",
