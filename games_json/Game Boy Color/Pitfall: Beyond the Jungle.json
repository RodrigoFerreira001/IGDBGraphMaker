    "summary": "An evil force known as Scourge is manipulating the Red Lucense in order to take over the jungle. Now it is up to Pitfall Harry Jr. to use the Blue Lucense to restore peace to the land. You control Harry as he battles through 15 levels that span jungles, volcanoes, prisons, and caverns. Each world has unique variations; for example, you have to swing from vines in the jungle stages, while using a pickaxe to battle scorpions and other monsters. For some additional help, Harry has quick reflexes to allow him to dodge bullets and jump over some of the bad guys. In addition to Harry's innate skills, there are power-ups scattered throughout the levels including extra lives, gold bars, crystals, and extra health. Help Harry restore peace to the jungle in PITFALL: Beyond the Jungle.",
