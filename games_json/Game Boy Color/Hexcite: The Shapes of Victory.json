    "summary": "The world's best strategy games have two things in common: they start with a deceptively simple board and the goal of taking territory from your opponents. Now HEXCITE brings a whole new shape to strategy games. In HEXCITE, 1 or 2 players battle to dominate the board with pieces of different shapes and sizes. Like any great strategy game, HEXCITE is simple to learn, but challenging to master. And every round is unpredictable until the last play. Who knows? HEXCITE could be the shape of things to come!",
