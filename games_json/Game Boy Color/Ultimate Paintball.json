    "summary": "Be careful when you wade into enemy territory or they will take you out of the game in ULTIMATE PAINTBALL. To win, you must capture the enemy's flag, and in order to accomplish this you will have drive deep into enemy territory and take out hoards of foot soldiers. Luckily, there are four different weapons to choose from that make eliminating the opposition easier. But don't get caught-up in the shooting, or you will run out of time and your flag will be captured. Fortunately, eliminating the enemies reveals arrows that show the way to the flag. While the game starts out with one flag, there will eventually be three flags to find. Try to capture the flag without getting shot in ULTIMATE PAINTBALL.",
