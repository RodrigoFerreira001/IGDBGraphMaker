    "summary": "Travel back to prehistoric times, with Disney's DINOSAUR for the Game Boy Color. Loosely based on the computer-animated feature film, players will have to guide Aladar the Iguanadon, Zini the Lemur, and Flia the Pteranodon through 12 different levels, using each of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Aladar's strength and brute force are great assets, but there are times when the smaller, quicker Zini will need to take over. Neither of them will do you any good if a situation calls for the ability to fly, though so it's a good thing Flia is with you on this adventure. Learning to use each of these characters to overcome obstacles is the key to avoiding extinction! With video taken directly from the film and an encyclopedia covering all the creatures in the game, Disney's DINOSAUR will immerse players in a world that existed millions of years ago.",
