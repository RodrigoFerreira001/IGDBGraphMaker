    "summary": "In the addictive, balloon-bursting tradition of POP 'N POP and BUST-A-MOVE comes YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast from Taito and Bam Entertainment. Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that's you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it's game over. If you're quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode. YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast is Cartoon Network-licensed, party-popping fun for your Game Boy Color.",
