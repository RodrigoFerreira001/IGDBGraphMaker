    "summary": "Laura discovers a diamond in her basement. After her grandfather tells her that diamonds will attract fairies when surrounded by the energy of good deeds, Laura travels throughout the city to find people in need of help. As with most large towns, there are plenty of people in need of assistance, and each of them sends Laura to complete a task. Fortunately, Laura is never in any real danger--if she makes a mistake, she can always repeat any mission. As another stroke of luck, the citizenry is always willing to help her. When she springs into action to help someone, Laura will enter one of 10 different mini-games that include platform jumping and jump rope. Get Laura to help the people in town, and try to call fairies with her diamond in PLAYMOBIL: Laura.",
