    "summary": "If you have any doubt as to E.T.'s ability to help you get organized, witness the stunning efficiency with which he expressed his desperate need to make a phone call. There's no need for a separate digital organizer anymore, as you can now keep track of your life on a Game Boy Color. Everyone's favorite little alien being provides a calendar, an address book, a working clock, and even a \"to-do\" list that will keep young science fiction fans motivated and productive. There are even five mini-games included, several of which involves helping the titular mascot evade the authorities and collect the necessary items to construct an inter-global telephone system. One of the games challenges you to raise a \"Flopgopple\" pet, and all of the options are compatible with the Nintendo Game Boy Printer. Kids can even protect all of their personal data with the use of an original password. Now, that's organization.",
