    "summary": "He might be wrinkled and a little bit slimy on the outside, but his heart is pure gold. Perhaps the most famous cinematic space alien ever to capture kids' imaginations, E.T. stars in this delightful adventure for the Game Boy Color. The title character's green thumb comes out to make its presence known in this installation of the story (remember, E.T. is an excellent gardener). Help the little guy travel to the farthest reaches of space collecting specimens of various plants for the Cosmic Garden that lives on his spaceship. Once you've collected all of the plants, the object of the game is to make sure they can stay alive in the Garden. New friends, Space Bee and Space Slug a couple of adorable additions to the saga will assist you. With addicting gameplay, excellent graphics, and classic characters, this is one game that's certainly worth phoning home about.",
