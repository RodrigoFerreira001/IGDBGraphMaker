Preschoolers love Elmo it's a simple fact of life and your kids or siblings will have a fun time here while they learn their numbers. There are four basic math concepts to be enjoyed: addition, subtraction, counting, and number pattern recognition. Elmo is the official welcoming committee to visitors from the Planet Zap, and he needs help counting all the stars so his visiting outerspace pals will turn the Sesame Street lights back on. Four cheerful and challenging games await: \"How Many Stars,\" \"Beam That Number,\" \"Adding Countdown,\" and \"Take It Away.\" In \"Stars.\" you'll count how many stars that a speeding spaceship has left in its wake; \"Beam\" has you beam a spotlight over three patterns. Correctly match the patterns to the number in the lower right hand of the screen and watch rockets blast into space. \"Countdown\" has you flying with your jetpack and solving three addition equations, and \"Take It Away\" is similar, only learning subtraction is the goal. SESAME STREET: Elmo's 123s from NewKidCo will keep you entertained while you master your numbers.",
