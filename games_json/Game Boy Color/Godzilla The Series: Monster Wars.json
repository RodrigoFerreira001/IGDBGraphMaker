You take control of the giant lizard in 10 levels of action that take place in deserts, cities, and underwater. Free-scrolling technology gives you total control of Godzilla, and new cross-hairs improve the accuracy of Godzilla\u2019s attacks that include fireball, tail whip, bite, claw, stomp, and flame breath. As an added bonus, all of the attacks can be linked together for unlimited combinations. And you are going to need those combinations to destroy the 16 types of enemies that Godzilla will face. Try to save the planet from giant monsters and aliens in GODZILLA THE SERIES: Monster Wars.",
