When you want to test your tactics, enter the race for the Stanley Cup in the Season mode. If getting through a Season is a bigger time investment than you want, just skip it and go straight to the Playoffs. When a friend challenges your domination of the rink, put him in his place with the link cable Two-Player mode. No matter what mode you play, you will have to win the game in a shootout if it's tied at the end of regulation. And if you get into a fight and lose, you will have to sit in the penalty box. Try to become the greatest hockey player in the world with NHL BLADES OF STEEL 2000.",
