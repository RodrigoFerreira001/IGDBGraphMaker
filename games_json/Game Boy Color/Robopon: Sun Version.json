    "summary": "Robopon are robotic creatures that inhabit the planet alongside humans. They can be captured and trained to battle other Robopon. You have just inherited Robopon Dispatching Company from your grandfather, but the business is failing. To start earning a profit, you must become the greatest Robopon master in the world. To do this, you must travel the globe, battling other Robopon masters and collecting the 150 species of Robopon. As Robopon battle, they gain experience and evolve into more powerful types. The cartridge also has an infrared sensor that will allow new attributes to be unlocked by shooting remote control beams into it. An internal clock is built in and will notify you of time-sensitive events. Try to catch them all in ROBOPON: Sun Version",
