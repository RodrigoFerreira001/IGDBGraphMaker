    "summary": "If you want the thrill of riding at high speeds on two wheels on a tight track with deadly curves and bone-jarring jumps, look no further TEST DRIVE CYCLES has all of that and more! You've got an assortment of bikes from licensed manufacturers such as Harley Davidson, BMW, Moto Guzzi, and Bimota. Once you've selected your speed machine, head to the track in one of 12 different racing circuits. Each course is packed with twists, turns, and jumps that will test your skill and push you to the edge. Watch out for other racers and obstacles as you speed to the finish line, or you may end up wrecking your fancy ride. By winning races, you can upgrade your bike with various parts that will increase your speed and handling. If you're looking for multiplayer action, link up to race against another player in a Head-to-Head race to the finish. There is also the Cop Chase mode, where you must avoid being pulled over by the fuzz. TEST DRIVE CYCLES is compatible only with Game Boy Color systems.",
