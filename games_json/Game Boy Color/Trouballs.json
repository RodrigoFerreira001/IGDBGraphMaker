    "summary": "If you're ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.",
