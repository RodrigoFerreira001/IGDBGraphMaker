While GEX was whiling away the hours living on the fruits of his recent successes, the madman of the Media Dimension was working on his new hobby - secret agent-napping. Agent Xtra was now struggling for her freedom as a hostage in the lair of Rez. As a master of disguise, GEX had his work cut out for him. Another descent into bad TV movies is at hand.
