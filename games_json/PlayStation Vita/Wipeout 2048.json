        "synopsis": "This is an action racing game in which players drive futuristic vehicles through fantastical urban settings. As players speed around each track, they can pick up a variety of power-ups (e.g., earthquakes, plasma beams, mines, rockets) to slow down and damage opponents. The somewhat frenetic races are highlighted by crashing sounds, colorful explosions, and scattered debris. In Combat mode, players earn points by destroying as many other vehicles as possible."

All events have pass and elite pass targets. Unless the elite pass criteria is met unknowingly, it will only be displayed after a player passes an event. If the player fails to complete an event multiple times in a row, the event can be skipped. Skipping an event will allow the player to move on to the next available event; a player can return to a skipped event at any time in order to try it again.",
