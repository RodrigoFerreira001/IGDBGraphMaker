        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players follow goddesses as they battle an evil force into an alternate dimension. As players explore dungeon-like areas, they engage in turn-based battle against goddesses and other enemies (e.g., crabs, ghosts, frogs). Characters use swords, axes, and lances to deplete enemies' hit points. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds and cries of pain. Some characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage and buttocks, (e.g., a bath sequence depicts characters whose breasts are barely covered by steam). Camera angles sometimes focus on female characters' underwear and chests. The dialogue also includes some suggestive material: \u201cEven if you get groped a bit\u2026you're tough enough to get over it!\u201d and \u201c[W]e're here making boob jokes.\u201d The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in dialogue."

Neptune\u2019s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late \u201880s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough \u2013 except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs, including Neptune! \n \nForging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the \u201880s forever?!",
