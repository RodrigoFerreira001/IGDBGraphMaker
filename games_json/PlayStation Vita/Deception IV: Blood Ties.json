        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Laegrinna, the Devil's Daughter, as she attempts to defeat her foes and resurrect her father. Players battle enemies by placing elaborate traps around grid-like battlefields. Enemies lured to traps can be killed by giant swinging axes, electrified helmets, walls of spikes, bladed exhaust fans, and other sharp instruments that impale characters. Enemies emit large splashes of blood when inured; blood is also depicted in pools under characters' bodies. During the course of the game, some female characters wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage or buttocks; characters' breasts jiggle during some sequences. Players have the ability to knock off enemy armor with an Armor Break, reducing female characters to their underwear. "

From rolling boulders and spiked walls to spring boards, iron maidens, human cannons, falling bathtubs and banana peels, the player can choose from a multitude of dramatic, sadistic, and comical traps in order to finish off an enemy. \n \nHowever, simply setting traps is not enough, as they need to be activated in turn. Timing also plays an important role, as an untimely activation could result in Laegrinna falling into her own trap or allowing her rivals to catch her. Depending on the manner in which an enemy is killed or captured, the Devil's three servants - Veruza, Caelea and Lilia (each representing a different aspect of cruelty: Sadistic Torment, Elaborate Death and Humiliating Demise) - reward points and upgraded traps.",
