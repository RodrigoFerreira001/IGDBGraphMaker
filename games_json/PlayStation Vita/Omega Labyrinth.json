    "summary": "Omega Labyrinth is an upcoming roguelike RPG developed by Matrix Software for the Playstation Vita. One of the systems in the game is the Omega Power. The embodiment of womanly strength, Omega Power is power which is stored in your chest \u2013 but also amounts to experience points. By gaining Omega Power through defeating monsters in the dungeon you can increase the size of your chest \u2013 with a jump in cup size also powering up your abilities. Another important system in the game is the \u201cFaint in Agony Awakening\u201d system, which you can use to strengthen your status and acquire new abilities. By using a \u201cFaint in Agony Aroma\u201d item found in a dungeon, you can excite one of the character and have her experience various delusions. By touching her during these delusions, her Omega Power and status will increase \u2013 with sensitive spots differing by character and situation.",
