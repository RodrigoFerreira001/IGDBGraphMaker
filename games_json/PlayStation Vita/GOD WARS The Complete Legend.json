    "storyline": "\"A long time ago, there was a beautiful land that was made up of three nations: Fuji, Izumo, and Hyuga. \n \nThis land was called Mizuho. The people of Mizuho were peaceful, didn't seek to cause conflicts, honored their ancestral spirits, and lived in harmony with nature. \n \nBut, as they developed cultivation technology, the people started relying on metal more and more, began having disputes, destroyed nature, and neglected their ancestral spirits. \n \nIn the midst of all this, natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, started happening all over Mizuho. \n \nIn order to prevent the destruction of the world, the Queen of the Fuji Nation, Tsukuyomi, sacrificed her beloved daughter, Sakuya, to the volcanic crater of Mount Fuji, and confined Sakuya's younger sister, Kaguya, within a bamboo seal to be a backup sacrifice. Then, Tsukuyomi disappeared. \n \n13 years later, Princess Kaguya has grown into a beautiful woman and escapes during a riot with the help of her childhood friend, Kintaro. \n \nKaguya resists her fate to be a sacrifice, and sets off on a journey across the land of Mizuho in order to discover the truth behind her mother's actions.\"",
