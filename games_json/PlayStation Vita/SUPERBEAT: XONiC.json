Accompanying artwork/animation occasionally depicts characters with drops of blood on their faces. There are also depictions of female figures wearing low-cut clothing that reveals cleavage or the undersides of their breasts; characters' breasts sometimes bounce during animated sequences. Song lyrics contain the word \u201csh*t.\u201d"
