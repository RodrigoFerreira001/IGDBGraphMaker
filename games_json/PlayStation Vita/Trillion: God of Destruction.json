        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players help the Demon King Zeabolos and his overlords defeat Trillion, the God of Destruction. As characters train and increase their strength, each overlord engages in turn-based combat with Trillion and its minions. Characters take turns moving around a grid and attacking enemies with swords, axes, or special attacks. Characters cry out when struck and disappear when their hit points have been depleted; battles are highlighted by impact sounds and light effects. One character is briefly shown with bloody scratches/wounds on his chest. Several female characters are depicted in outfits that reveal large amounts of their breasts/cleavage (e.g., steam or towels barely covering breasts and buttocks; exaggerated-size breasts spilling out of a bra-like top.). Dialogue and dialogue choices sometimes reference sexual material (e.g., \"I'm ready for any kind of naughtiness you want, as rough as you want it;\u201d \u201cShe's good at being dominant, but she's not used to being in a submissive position\u201d; \u201cwet dream come true\u201d). During the course of the game, a demon character is depicted smoking a cigar; one prolonged sequence involves two characters discussing sake and drinking a bottle (e.g., \u201c[E]ver since I was reborn in to this body, I just can't hold my liquor quite like I used to;\u201d \u201cYou just chugged the whole thing?!\u201d). The word \"sh*t\" appears in dialogue. "

Trillion sleeps after eating part of the underworld giving you a chance to train. You will have 6 attempts at stopping Trillion before the underworld is gone.\n\nYou choose from one of three Overlords to train at the start. You have a set amount of time to train and prepare for the fight against trillion to defend the underworld. You can train stats, learn skills, go into a dungeon to gather items, strengthen weapons, and rest to get rid of fatigue. You can also interact with the Overlord to raise affection points, raise affection to a certain level and events related to the Overlord will occur.\n\nAffection points are also used in the battle against Trillion where they act as a buffer for your health and mana. As long as you still have affection points in the battle you will also have the option to retreat from the battle, giving up a section of the underworld for more time to train. If the Overlords health reaches 0 they will be able to activate a final death skill that could deal massive damage, seal one of Trillion's attacks, or stop Trillion's advance for a longer training period. The Overlords items, equipment, and seals will be passed on to the next Overlord you train along with a portion experience.",
