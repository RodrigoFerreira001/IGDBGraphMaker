        "synopsis": "This is a visual novel in which players follow the story of two detectives investigating crimes in a futuristic city. Players watch events as they unfold and make decisions that affect the storyline. Some action choices result in off-screen characters being killed by laser blasts. Violence is also described in text (e.g., \u201cAll I heard was the crackling of the flames as they consumed my body\u201d and \u201cA direct hit. . . Her body swelled then burst. Well, most of it. Some parts remained. Like her hands. . .\u201d). One sequence depicts an injured character lying in a pool of blood after a bomb explosion. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters in outfits that depict large amounts of cleavage; dialogue/text that states, \u201cHe said he should've at least had sex with her, then he laughed and looked all creepy\u201d and \u201cAhh Nadeshiko, your large, beautiful chest looks so good in this dress.\u201d A storyline in the game revolves around the use and abuse of fictional drugs; the dialogue/text includes several references to such drugs (e.g., \"A cocktail? You mean like combining multiple drugs?\" and \"This cocktail had spread throughout the school, and all the captors were addicts.\"). The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue."
