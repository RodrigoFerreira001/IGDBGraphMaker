        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a young fighter who searches dungeons for ingredients to make a special mixture. Players move through dungeons using a grid system, and use swords, knives, or inventory items (e.g., bombs) to attack enemies (e.g., humans and monsters). Characters yell/shriek when struck; \u201chit point\u201d numbers are depicted above characters' heads when damaged. During the course of the game, some female characters wear low-cut tops that expose large amounts of cleavage. Characters also engage in suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cWhen it's hot, my cleavage gets all sweaty,\u201d \u201cThose with neat, compact boobies can still enjoy life, right?\" \"It's like he's eye-humping me!\u201d and \u201c[H]e likes to pinch random girls' behinds.\u201d). The game includes several tongue-in-cheek references/allusions to drugs [e.g., \u201cKing's UberDrug,\u201d \u201cGod's UberDrug: Boosts your intelligence. And it's (mostly) legal!\u201d \u201cSad Guy Pill: Why the rush? Just chill. Relax. Go sloooow\u2026\u201d and \u201cMushroom is colored with psychedelic stars and rainbow.\u201d]."
