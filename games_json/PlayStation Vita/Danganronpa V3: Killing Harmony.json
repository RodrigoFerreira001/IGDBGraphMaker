        "synopsis": "This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow students attempting to escape from a mysterious academy. As players explore the academy's hallways and rooms, they investigate the murders of several characters, searching for clues in order to judge/punish the killers. Players engage in a variety of mini-games to analyze evidence and organize clues. In addition to the depiction of bloody corpses in several scenes, players are able to trigger elaborate \u201cpunishment\u201d cutscenes in which intense acts of violence are depicted: students boiled/burned to death, sliced by saw blades, hung by the neck, set on fire, stabbed through the chest by giant insects. Blood is frequently depicted during these cutscenes and gameplay. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cThink of me during your next tug session!\u201d; \u201cHey crotchrot, you staring at my t*ts?\u201d; \u201cThe kinda stuff that gives me a raging b*ner!\u201d; \u201cBy day you're fingerin' the piano keys, by night the dudes are fingerin'...\"). A handful of scenes depict partially nude figures with exposed buttocks and breasts. Dialogue briefly mentions drug use (e.g., \u201cI need strong meds cuz I wanna trip...\u201d; I'm jonesing for a leaf!\u201c; \u201cYou can't use drugs to get high!\u201d). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in dialogue."
