        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players help a set of twins recover their lost memory. As players explore a magical world, they can collect and raise fantasy creatures called Mirages to help traverse environments and battle enemy creatures (e.g., goblins, golems) in turn-based combat. Players use weapon attacks and magical abilities (e.g., drain, fire, poison) to defeat enemies; battles are accompanied by impact sounds and mild explosions. A handful of sequences also depict additional acts of violence: a vampire stabbed (off-screen) in the chest with a stake; characters turned to dust in a fiery blast. The game contains some suggestive material: female character in outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; dialogue that states, \u201cOn the one hand, he must flirt with all the ladies\u201d and \u201cOh, this one's a tasty morsel! I'd love to get my tentacles around her . . .\u201d The game includes a brief reference to alcohol in a character description: \"A consummate connoisseur, it pairs fine wines with the brains it devours.\" The word \u201chell\u201d appears in the dialogue."
