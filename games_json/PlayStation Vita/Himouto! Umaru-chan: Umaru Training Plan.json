    "summary": "Himouto! Umaru-chan: Umaru Training Plan is an upcoming Japanese visual novel and a simulation game based on the Himouto! Umaru-chan manga franchise. The game puts players in the role of Taihei Doma, brother of the seemingly perfect and beautiful Umaru Doma, who secretly converts to an otaku, is lazy, and eats junk food when at home. During Training Parts, players will communicate with and help Umaru get rid of her sloppy lifestyle, with her improving based on your level of communication. During adventure parts, the game will play out like a traditional visual novel. The story will change depending on the player\u2019s choices. The same actors from the anime will voice the characters, with the game\u2019s heroines being fully voiced.",
