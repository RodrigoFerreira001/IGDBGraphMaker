        "synopsis": "This is a rhythm game in which players follow a group of students through a mystery involving a strange website and a group of pop stars. Players match timed button presses to on-screen prompts in order to dance their way through confrontations with creatures (e.g., shadow monsters, marionettes, robots). A handful of cutscenes depict brief instances of violence: a still image of a man shooting another character (blood stains the victim's shirt); a figure in silhouette hanging herself. The game also contains suggestive material: characters wearing revealing outfits (e.g., deep cleavage); characters discussing the sex appeal of other female characters (e.g.,\u201cHer chest is like, BAM, while her waist is so slim!\u201d; \u201cI love how she seems so\u2026seductive\u201d). One cutscene briefly depicts a female character in the shower, with steam/mist partially covering her chest. The word \u201csh*t\u201d is heard in the dialogue."

    "summary": "Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a story-driven music game of the cult hit RPG Persona 4, developed by ATLUS. Replacing the RPG elements are dance battles that challenge players' dexterity and accuracy, as they tap out re-mixes of fan-favorite themes and brand new music tracks. The storyline continues from after the events of Persona 4, when the teenage mega-idol, Rise Kujikawa, returns to the city to re-take her show biz career. During that time, a strange video appears on the internet and the unfortunate people who watched it have gone missing! Members of Kanamin Kitchen, Rise's junior idol group, have disappeared and it's up to the Investigation team to mount a rescue mission - only they discover the same monstrous Shadows from the Midnight Channel. To make matters even worse, their Persona abilities are rendered ineffective, and the Shadows in P4D can only be defeated by dance, so bust out powerful dance moves to save the day!",
