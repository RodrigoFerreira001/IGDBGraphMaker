    "summary": "Anonymous;Code is an upcoming Japanese visual novel. The theme of the game is \u201chacking.\u201d The hero, Poron Takaoka, is a hacker that can \u201cloop\u201d using an ability called \u201csave and load,\u201d which allows him to save and load life like a video game. Unlike Steins;Gate\u2018s concept of infinitely expanding horizontal world lines, Anonymous;Code is made up of infinitely expanding vertical \u201cWorld Layers.\u201d Using the \u201cHacking Trigger\u201d system, the hero can intervene in the layers below his. Additionally, while its connection to the story is unknown, it\u2019s also possible for the protagonist's save data to be hacked. Despite being by the same makers and sharing a similar naming scheme, Anonymous;Code is not a part of 5pb's Science Adventure series of adventure games.",
