        "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of Zen, a ninja seeking revenge in a mythical land. From a third-person perspective, players engage in missions that involve assassinations, kidnappings, and one-on-one duels. Players use swords, explosives, and throwing stars to kill enemies during the melee-style combat. Players can also execute a stealth move (i.e., Chimatsuri Sappo) in which enemies are impaled from behind. Some attacks are highlighted by screams of pain, gurgling noises, and realistic explosions; sword slashes often result in exaggerated sprays of blood."
