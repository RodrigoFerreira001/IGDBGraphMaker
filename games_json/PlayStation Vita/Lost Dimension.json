        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the roles of young soldiers with psychic abilities as they battle evil forces intent on destroying the world. As they progress through the story, players engage in turn-based battles against robots, droids, and occasionally human enemies. Characters use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, swords, and psychic abilities (e.g., pyrokinesis, telekinesis) to deplete enemies' hit points. Robots and droids explode when defeated; human characters cry out in pain and collapse when defeated. Splashes of blood occasionally appear when sword-wielding characters flick their blades after a slashing attack. A handful of scenes contain suggestive dialogue: \u201cI've no intention of accepting your friendliness tinged in sexual desire\u201d; \u201c[I] wouldn't know in terms of physical pleasure. I've never had sex before;\u201d \u201c[I]'m sure the chance to debut is higher with a cute face and big boobs.\u201d The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in dialogue."
