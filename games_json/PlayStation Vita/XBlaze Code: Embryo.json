        "synopsis": "This is an interactive story game (i.e., visual novel) in which players follow a high-school student's quest to solve a mysterious attack. Still-frame cutscenes sometimes show characters attacking and killing enemies with swords and magic attacks. Characters are sometimes depicted with blood stains on their clothing; one crime scene depicts a corpse lying in a pool of blood. During the course of the game, female characters often wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also includes suggestive material (e.g., \u201cEs, your boobs are spectacularly huge\u201d and \u201cWait, why are you touching me there?\u201d); an extended pool sequence depicts several bikini-clad women in suggestive poses (e.g., on knees, bending over). A handful of female characters are nearly topless (e.g., steam, bright lights obscuring detail) or have their buttocks exposed. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in dialogue."
