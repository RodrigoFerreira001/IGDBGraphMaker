A month later, he finds out that the girl is his classmate, Megumi, who is hardly noticed by the other classmates. Tomoya, who also has no special skills or abilities, goes to Sawamura Spencer Eriri, a well-known member of the Art Club, to provide the art for a game the club is developing, and to Kasumigoaka Utaha to write the game scenario. The three subsequently form Blessing Software, which they plan to sell at the next Comiket.", 
    "summary": "Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata -blessing flowers- is a Japanese visual novel based on the Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata light novel franchise. The novel has multiple routes featuring the different heroines of the game. One of the features of the game is an \"Otaku Mode\" system, where the player can lend the heroines different light novels, games or anime DVDs to change their dialogue and personality. The game utilizes Live 2D software, which moves the characters with CGI, but retains their two-dimensional look.",
