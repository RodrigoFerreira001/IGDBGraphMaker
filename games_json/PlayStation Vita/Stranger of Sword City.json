        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a plane crash survivor exploring a strange dimension. As players explore dungeon-like environments, they engage in turn-based battles with fantastical enemies (e.g., goblins, demons, monsters, dragons). Players select combat moves from a menu screen; characters lose hit points and flash/flicker when struck. Cutscenes also include instances of violence and blood: a female character lying in a pool of blood; a knight impaled by a lance. One scene depicts a creature being decapitated; some enemies appear as floating severed heads trailing small amounts of blood. Some female creatures are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples), and other characters are shown wearing low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage. During the course of the game, players learn about an in-game item called \u201cpoiney powder\u201d that is described as a narcotic with addictive qualities. The words \u201cb*tch,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in the dialogue."
