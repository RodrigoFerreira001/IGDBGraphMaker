        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players form a six-member squad to battle monsters called Variants. As players explore dungeons and labyrinths, they engage in turn-based battles against a variety of fantastical Variants (e.g., demons, mutant animals, robots). Players select attack moves from a series of menus; characters flinch when attacked as their hit points decrease. A handful of cutscenes depict corpses lying among large pools of blood; still-screen images sometimes depict dismembered torsos with visible intestines. Some demon characters are depicted topless (without nipples), with exaggerated-sized breasts. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue."
