        "synopsis": "This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow high-school students attempting to escape a dangerous tropical island. As players navigate the island, they sometimes come upon corpses of murdered classmates. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing fellow survivors. Finding the killer can trigger \u201cpunishment\u201d cutscenes in which acts of violence are depicted: students thrown into a volcano, trampled by animals, stabbed by sword-wielding robots. A handful of still-frame cutscenes also depict characters impaled by spikes and hanging from ceilings. Blood is sometimes depicted on and around corpses. Cutscenes also depict female characters dressed in low-cut outfits and bikinis that expose large amounts of cleavage; these still images occassionally depict characters in provocative poses, with the camera focusing on pelvic areas. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cThat creep rubbed his ham-hands all over me and called it a body check! More like sexual harassment!\u201d \u201cMy loins are still full of poison, and I'd appreciate it if you could suck it out\u2026\u201d and \u201csome even tried to have children with Junko's dead body\u201d). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the game."
