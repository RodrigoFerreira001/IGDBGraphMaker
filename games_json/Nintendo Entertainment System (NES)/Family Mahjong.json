Uniquely, at least for the time, it does include a full tutorial mode that will teach the player how to actually play mahjong. It also includes rules for mahjong gambling, which is another feature included in the game. After the player has learned how to play, they can compete against a series of CPU opponents in one-on-one matches, most of whom are attractive blonde women for whatever reason.",
