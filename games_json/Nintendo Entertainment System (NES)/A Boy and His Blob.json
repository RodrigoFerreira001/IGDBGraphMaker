Enemy blobs appear as obstacles, but can be defeated with the aid of the sidekick. Coconuts can be tossed, anvils can be dropped, pits can be dug, and punches can be thrown to defeat the blobs. During one sequence, players can enter a mechanical contraption that allows them to punch, jump on, or crush enemies. Blobs burst apart with a \"squishing\" sound effect when defeated."
