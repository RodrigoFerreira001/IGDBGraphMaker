    "summary": "The first in Hudson's series of train-themed video board games which was released on the Famicom in Japan only on December 2nd 1988. \n \nMomotaro Dentetsu (\"Momotaro's Railway\") is a train-themed board game featuring the folklore hero of Momotaro, the Peach Boy. It is the first in Hudson's long-running series of the same name. The goal is for each player to drive a train around a board by rolling a die and trying to make as much money as possible, a la board games like Monopoly or the Game of Life. \n \nThe game and its series is not to be confused with Momotaro Densetsu, an earlier RPG from Hudson featuring the same characters.",
