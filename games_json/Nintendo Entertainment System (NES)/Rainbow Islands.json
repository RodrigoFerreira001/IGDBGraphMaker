The game is subtitled \"The Story of Bubble Bobble 2\" and is the sequel to Taito's hit game Bubble Bobble from the previous year. It is the second of four arcade games in the Bubble Bobble series (followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories, but itself has two direct sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2). The game was ported for numerous home computers and game consoles. \n \nThe main characters are Bubblun and Bobblun, the protagonists of Bubble Bobble (known as \"Bub and Bob\" in the western releases). However, in this game they appear in their human forms as \"Bubby\" and \"Bobby\", as opposed to the \"bubble dragons\" of the first game (following on from the first game's true ending). Also unlike the first game, players must now \"alternate\" (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt) (the same color scheme as in the first game).",
