    "summary": "An adventure game for the NES published by Sunsoft. It is based on a Japanese manga set during a historical Chinese civil war. \n \nSekiryuou (often translated as \"Red Dragon King\") is a traditional Famicom adventure game from Sunsoft, in which the player controls a protagonist via a series of menus in order to solve a series of puzzles. Though Sunsoft is credited as publisher, it is unclear if the game was made in-house or contracted to another developer. \n \nThe game, and the manga it is based on, depict a period of ancient Chinese history between the Qin and Han dynasties, a few decades before the Three Kingdoms era began. As expected of a transitional period, there was plenty of intrigue and conflict leading up to the change of power that future novels and mangas could draw from.",
