It is said than an ancient legend is somehow connected to this highway. Players must knock enemies off the road by using missiles before they can knock him off the same highway. Automobile repair shops can be found where cars can be repaired and re-supplied with much-needed weapons. The playable vehicle resembles a 1982 DeLorean DMC-12 while the unplayable enemy vehicles resemble dune buggies. \n \nThe game has an infinite amount of continues and a meter appears on the bottom left-hand side of the screen to remind how close the player is to achieving the goal.",
