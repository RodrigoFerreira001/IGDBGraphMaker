    "summary": "Family Mahjong II: Shanghai e no Michi is a Mahjong game released only in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom. \n \nFamily Mahjong II: Shanghai e no Michi is a Mahjong game and the direct sequel to Family Mahjong. In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament. \n \nThe game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of having only a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.",
