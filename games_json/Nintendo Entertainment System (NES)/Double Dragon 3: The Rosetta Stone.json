She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them. \n \nThis game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in their quest. \n \nPower-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack. \n \nThe character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.",
