    "summary": "The Kingdom Of Oltaria is a peaceful one, thanks to the power of its Lord King \nAkinas. The king's daughter, Princess FAQS, is about to turn 16, but one day an \nevil old man known as the Black Master turns up determined to have FAQS for \nhimself, and he drags her into the world of nightmares: the Black Dream. The \nPrinces is trapped in a deep sleep, and the king summons adventurers from all \nover the kingdom to kill the villain and rescue the Princess. They enter the \nBlack Dream but never return, at least, never wake up. \n \nOne day, Sir Kleith, the Captain of the Royal Guard, decides to go to search \nfor the Dream Sage in a forest to the south of Oltaria. Eventually, after a \ndifficult journey, Kleith arrives at his destination, where the Dream Sage is \ntraining a young disciple called GAME to be a Dream Master. (A Dream Master's \nrole is to bring peace and tranquillity to dreams and their powers must be used \nto heal and not to corrupt souls.) Anyway, poor old Kleith dies after \ndelivering his message about the plight of the Princess. \n \nThe Dream Sage says he's too old to undertake the task of saving the Princess \nbut GAME can do it! This is when the action begins, as GAME falls asleep and \nthe Black Master appears, to transport him into the first Black Dream where his \nskills are put to the test!",
