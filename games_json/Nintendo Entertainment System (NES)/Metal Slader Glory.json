    "summary": "Eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. Tadashi Himukai, a 17-year-old war orphan, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: \"EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR\". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.",
