To complete a level, a player must guess the correct picture that is being drawn by the computer on the screen-this must be done multiple times and in different categories. Different difficulties were available in the game, and four different categories.", 
    "summary": "Anticipation was marketed as Nintendo's \"first video board game\", and was developed by Rare for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. It allowed for single player against computer-controlled opponents, as well as multiplayer with support for up to four players.",
