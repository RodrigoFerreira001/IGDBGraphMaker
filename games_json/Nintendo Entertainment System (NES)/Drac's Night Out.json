The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. \n \nIn the game the player controlled the infamous Count Dracula who, while wearing Reebok Pumps, had to first work his way down his castle while avoiding the hostile villagers. This could be accomplished by hypnotizing the villagers with your vampiric gaze, or by pulling a lever to spring one of many Rube Goldberg-esque hidden traps.",
