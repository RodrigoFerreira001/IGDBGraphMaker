    "storyline": "Set in a galaxy creatively named the Bomber Nebula, the original Bomberman did not incorporate an official storyline but focused purely on the puzzle aspect of the game. When Bomberman was re-released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, a story was incorporated into the gameplay. \nIn the NES version of Bomberman, the title character grows tired of making bombs in an underground factory in the Bungeling Empire. Bomberman finds out that if a robot is able to reach the surface, it can become human. The title character decides to escape, and is turned into an organic human being known as the \"Runner\".", 
    "summary": "Bomberman was released in 1983 as a home computer game available on the MSX, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-6001, Sharp MZ-700 and FM-7 in Japan. It was released in a censored version under a different name (Eric and the Floaters) in Europe, and was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. The game allows the player to navigate Bomberman through a series of mazes while avoiding enemies and clearing a path with bombs. It is an early creation of Hudson Soft, and spawned a long-running series of games revolving around the title character.",
