But Wally's stashed your friends in dangerous spots all over New Zealand and it's up to you to save them. Beak up, Tiki! Just rely on your quick wit and fast footsies. And keep your bow and arrow on the draw, because every Kiwi Kraze creature you meet will try to do you in - from playful penguins to ornery octopi. Hurry up! Better find your birdie buddies in time. Wally's got himself a kiwi cookbook, and your friends are the main ingredient!",
