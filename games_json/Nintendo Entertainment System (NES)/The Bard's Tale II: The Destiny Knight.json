There's a slime ball conjurer just out of reach who'll keep summoning these slobbering missiles until your sword arm drops off. Unless you can figure out a way to get at him. \n \nWhen you put Mangar out to pasture, all you really wanted was a bottomless mug and an ace up your sleeve. So what are you doing out here in the gnarly wilderness, knee deep in wolf meat, itching to put an arrow through the Adam's apple of some spell caster? \n \nIt must be your destiny. \n \nBetween the six cities lies an immense wilderness. It's a mapping challenge never before seen in a fantasy game, and a whole new way to get lost. \n \nA new class of magic user, the Archmage has 8 powerful spells like Heal All, Fanskar's Night Lance, and the legendary Mangar's Mallet. \n \nThere are 25 different full-color scrolling mazes like Fanskar's Castle.",
