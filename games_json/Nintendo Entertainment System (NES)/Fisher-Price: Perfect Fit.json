Inside the game board are outlines of these same objects, just waiting for you to move the pictures into their correct outlines. Play at your own level, from simple matches to matches requiring up-down or side-to-side flips. Play alone and better your time, or play against a friend or even the computer to see who's quicker. Whichever way you do it, it's great fun!",
