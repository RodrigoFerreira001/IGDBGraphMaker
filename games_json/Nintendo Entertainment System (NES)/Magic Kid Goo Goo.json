    "summary": "If you like Korean Famicom games, this one should be right up your alley. It's made by some of the guys who went on to form Open Corp (the team that made Buzz & Waldog), and that game's DNA is really obviously present in this one - those same sound effects ripped off from Tiny Toon Adventures, a similar aesthetic, etc. In a lot of ways this game is simpler, but in many others it's actually a way more ambitious game, complete with a shop system, minigames, lots of character upgrades, etc. The ROM size is even twice that of Buzz & Waldog!",
