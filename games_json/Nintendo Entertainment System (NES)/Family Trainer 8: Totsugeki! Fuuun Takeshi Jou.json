Fuun Takeshijou is based on the popular TV show Takeshi's Castle, where contestants are pitted against each other in a series of generally absurd physical challenges in order to storm the castle of a character based on Japanese entertainment icon \"Beat\" Takeshi Kitano. \n \nThe game required that the player use the Family Trainer (known as the Power Pad elsewhere) accessory to complete a series of athletics-based challenges to reach the final boss round, which involved driving a small tank around and defeating opponents including Takeshi.",
