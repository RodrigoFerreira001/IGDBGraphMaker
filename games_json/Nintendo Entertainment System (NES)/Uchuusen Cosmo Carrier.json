A huge squadron of spaceships piloted by hostile alien forces came out of an artificial planet constructed near Pluto. A ragtag defense force has been assembled by the leaders of humanity in the hopes of being able to fend of the invasion. \n \nOnly a photon missile, invented by the extraterrestrials themselves, can destroy this fake planet and bring a halt to this invasion. The earth only has 100 days left to live unless the commander of the Cosmo Carrier can succeed in his duties.",
