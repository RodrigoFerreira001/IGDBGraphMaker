    "summary": "A stock market simulation game from Hect for the NES. Like most, but not all, NES stock market simulators it was never released outside of Japan. \n \nKabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation (\"Kabushiki\" is the Japanese stock market, and \"doujou\" is, of course, dojo) is a stock trading simulation game, where the aim is to invest wisely in the stock market and develop a bountiful portfolio. The player is given regular money goals to reach before the next target is due and can buy, sell and manage their stocks to achieve as much wealth as possible. \n \nThe game uses a lot of public domain classical music, such as the title screen's 8-bit rendition of Bach's Air on a G String.",
