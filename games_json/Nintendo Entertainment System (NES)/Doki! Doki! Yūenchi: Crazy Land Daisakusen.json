    "summary": "Doki! Doki! Y\u016benchi: Crazy Land Daisakusen is a Nintendo Family Computer video game developed by KID and released in 1991 by VAP. Players control a boy with a helmet who kicks balls at enemies in an attempt to save his girlfriend from an unknown force inside an amusement park. The more damage he takes the more damage he does to enemies. \n \nThe game was originally called Doki! Doki! Y\u016benchi (\u30c9\u30ad!\u30c9\u30ad!\u904a\u5712\u5730?) in Japanese, meaning \"Thump! Thump! Amusement Park\". Doki (\u30c9\u30ad?) is a Japanese onomatopoeia. \n \nThe game was renamed The Trolls in Crazyland for release on the NES by American Softworks. It was previously scheuled to be released as Crazyland, but was then changed to feature the popular Troll dolls. That version was only released in Italy(PAL-A), and Eastern Europe(PAL-B).",
