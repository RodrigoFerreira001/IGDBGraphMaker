    "summary": "The game is a side-scrolling adventure game where you control the famous Warner Brothers cartoon character Bugs Bunny on a quest to get to his 50th birthday party. He is armed with a mallet that he can swing at various enemies to defeat them, deflect certain projectiles or destroy bricks. He can also collect hearts to restore his health and carrots for bonus points. At the end of each level, Bugs Bunny had to use his mallet to defeat a Warner Brothers cartoon character such as Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, or the Tasmanian Devil. These other Looney Tunes characters are trying to stop Bugs because they are all jealous that Bugs gets all the attention. \nLevels: \n1: Grass land (Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Daffy, Wile E. Coyote) \n2: Desert (Daffy, Tweety, Yosemite Sam) (Level 2-3 has no boss) \n3: Evening Canyon (Daffy, Elmer Fudd, Daffy, Sylvester Cat) \n4: Night Caves (Daffy, Tweety, Daffy, Pepe le Pew) \n5: Jungle (Daffy, Elmer Fudd, Daffy, Foghorn Leghorn) \n6: Temple (Daffy, Elmer Fudd, Daffy, Tazmanian Devil)",
