A reptilian creature called Baragon is creating earthquakes in an oil refinery, a high-speed pterosaur named Rodan is leaving sonic booms in his wake, a hideous blob of slime called Hedorah is feeding off of the city's toxic waste and growing larger every second, a giant caterpillar named Mothra is laying eggs in different parts of town, a giant octopus is destroying fishing ships in the harbor and devouring their crews, a terrible three-headed hydra named King Ghidorah is bringing fire to the skies, and Godzilla is plowing through everything around him. To make matters worse, a fleet of alien saucers has begun an invasion. Only the J.S.D.F. can stop them.", 
    "summary": "The earth is besieged by Godzilla and monsters, and is in a critical situation. Who will be the ultimate winner, human wisdom or the instincts of the monsters?
