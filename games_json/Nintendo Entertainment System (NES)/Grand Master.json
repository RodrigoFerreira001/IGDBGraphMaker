This is the castle of the brave hero Kaizer who bore the title of \"Grand Master.\" He was the one who sealed the Devil known as Dante and brought peace to the whole world. \n \nBut when Dante came back to life, the seal weakened. For starters, the Devil obliterated all the humans inside the castle and populated it with monsters. They say the monster that abducted Siren is inside this castle too. \n \nWithout having a clue as to Dante's whereabouts, Rody went to the Kaizer Castle in search of a mere trace.",
