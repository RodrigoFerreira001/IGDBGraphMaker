    "summary": "Namco Classic (\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af?) is a golf game developed by Namco and published for the Famicom in 1988. The game features Round Play, which you can use to practice the course in the game or compete with friends, or Tournament mode, where you play against a computer opponent in an effort to win a large amount of prize money. The game was also released for the Game Boy in 1991. The Game Boy version features a different course but is very similar in many respects. In 1996, that version was also included in the compilation title, Namco Gallery Vol. 1.",
