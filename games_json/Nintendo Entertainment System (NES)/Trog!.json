Here's your chance to change the course of history and save the dinosaurs. Don't become Trog's Stone Age feast! Instead, use your reflexes and wits racing through 50 fun-filled islands, packed with dino-mite action and surprises. You'll witness the greatest inventions of all time: fire, the wheel, the pogo stick (the pogo stick?) - all invented by Trog to catch his dinner - you! Just watch out for the Tar Pits... sticky business. You've got special pick-ups to keep that carnivorous chow hound in check, like pineapples that turn you into a ferocious Trog-munching T-Rex. It's like this: either you save the Dinos... or you're extinct!",
