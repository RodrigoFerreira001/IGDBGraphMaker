It was the recipient of an extremely positive profile in Nintendo Power \u2014 \u201cextremely positive\u201d being NP\u2018s default setting back in the day \u2014 but then vanished, presumably never to be seen again. Last week, though, the archivists at Lost Levels not only acquired the long-lost prototype cartridge, but uploaded a playable version of it to the Internet.",
