Constructed at a lagrange point were three huge space colonies: the Isis Cluster (two artificial biospheres, named Land-1 and Land-2, and a satellite). In the year Isis 0024 (55 years after the cluster was constructed), however, a biohazard outbreak occurred on Land-2. All attempts at contact were met with nothing but static. Now a research team led by pilot Jin approaches Land-1",
