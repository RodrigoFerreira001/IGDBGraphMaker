    "summary": "The first in a series of murder mystery games by Taito penned by and named for Japanese mystery writer Misa Yamamura. The game was released only in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom on December 11, 1987. \n \nYamamura Misa Suspense: Kyoto Ryuu no Tera Satsujin Jiken (roughly \"Yamamura Misa Suspense: Murder Case of the Kyoto Buddhist Temple Dragon\") is the first in a series of murder mystery games from Taito, based on the work of prolific Japanese mystery writer Yamamura Misa. \n \nLike many of its Famicom crime adventure game peers the goal is to track down a killer using the provided detective skills: examining crime scenes, collecting evidence and talking to suspects and other helpful NPCs. \n \nThe game, and its sequels, were never localized or released outside of Japan.",
