    "summary": "Julian, a wandering vagabond who carries a beat-up lute, has happened upon the land of Varekai, a place where Strazno, Mystic of Chaos, seems to rule. Once, to hear its citizens tell the tale, Varekai was a normal place where nothing untoward or out of the ordinary happened whatsoever. But these are interesting days, as Sirena, Mvstic of Time, might call them. An unpeakable evil has awoken in the Hamishago mines and thrown the whole of Palacido Forest into upheaval. \n \nMaybe a wandering adventurer Will have the courage to take up the hero\u2019s mantle, and venture deep into the mines to face Whatever lurks there... assuming he has the fortitude to make it that far. Hint... that wandering adventurer is Julian! So get going! Talk to everyone, use your wits, resourcefulness and reflexes to find your way into Palacido and investigate the trouble!",
