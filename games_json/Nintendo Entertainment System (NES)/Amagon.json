The player must guide Amagon through the island to reach the rescue ship, defeating a number of foes-including the final boss, which is based on the \"Flatwoods Monster\", a rumoured space alien residing in Flatwoods, West Virginia. \nThe original Japanese version departs from the above in that the main character is not a marine, but is instead a scientist named \"Jackson\" who transforms himself into his Macho-Man form using a special drug.",
