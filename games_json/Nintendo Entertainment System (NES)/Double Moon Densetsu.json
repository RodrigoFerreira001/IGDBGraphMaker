It is based on an earlier play-by-mail RPG also titled Double Moon Densetsu, serialized in Marukatsu Famicom and eventually Marukatsu Super Famicom; in addition to this computer game, there was also a tabletop RPG system produced based on the work. \n \nA deity named Fatima created a world with two different continents; that divided the world of sorcery from the world of swordsmanship. An evil demon plans to destroy this world by bringing forth a dark dragon from a demonic dimension.",
