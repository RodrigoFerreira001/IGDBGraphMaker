    "summary": "A long long time ago, longer than anyone can remember, evil decended upon the \ngood and peaceful people of Fairyland. Old legends tell of a lone brave hero who \nsaved Fairyland from the imminent threat of doom. Since then, the people of \nFairyland have lived through centuries and centuries of peace, and all memories \nof evil faded away. \n \nBut one especially dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the \ndeepest depths of Fairyland, lighting the night sky. The next morning, strange \ndoors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, \nbut were never seen again. \n \nFrom that day on, unusual events and catastrophes began to take place. Huge \ncracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands. Floods wiped out \nentire villages, and the people of Fairyland experienced famine. And then the \nmonsters came. \n \nThe Fairyland council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A \nwise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young \nman who could save Fairyland from its gravest crisis. \n \nA young man was chosen to find the reason and source of the evil. As the people \ngathered to bid him farewell and good luck, they couldn't help but wonder if \nthey had chosen the right one.",
