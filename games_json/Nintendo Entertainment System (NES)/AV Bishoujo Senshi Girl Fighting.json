It reuses a lot of resources from Street Fighter IV and Kart Fighter with some Master Fighter II stuff mixed in and most of the girls are based off of characters from Ranma 1/2 Chounai Gekitou-hen and Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Fighting. Chun-Li in the game is from Street Fighter II: The World Warrior and Marry is Bunny from Street Fighter IV. You are awarded with hentai every time you beat a round when the difficulty is on 3, 4 or 5. These are backported from various PC98 H-games, such as Ten Sen Nyan Nyan.",
