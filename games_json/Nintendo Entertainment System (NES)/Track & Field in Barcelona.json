    "summary": "Track & Field, known in Japan as Hyper Olympic (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af Haip\u0101 Orinpikku?), is a 1983 Olympic-themed sports arcade game developed and published by Konami. The Japanese release sported an official license for the 1984 Summer Olympics. \n \nThe arcade version was released in 1983. The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades. \n \nThe NES version of Track & Field was re-released in Europe in 1992 as Track & Field in Barcelona by Kemco in the light of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The opening song for the NES version is the Chariots of Fire theme by Vangelis (which was also used in the arcade version's high score screen).",
