    "summary": "An adventure game based on an anime film of the same name, published for the Famicom by Kemco. \n \nToki no Tabibito \"Time Stranger\" is an adventure game with a heavy emphasis on text commands and dialogue, similar to other NES adventure games like Portopia Serial Murder Case or Hokkaido Serial Murders: Fade to Okhotsk. \n \nUnlike Portopia and its sequels, there is very little detective work to be done. The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves. \n \nWhile there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.",
