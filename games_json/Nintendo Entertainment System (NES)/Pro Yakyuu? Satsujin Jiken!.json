    "summary": "A comedic adventure game that satirizes the heavy number of baseball and murder mystery games for the Famicom. It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only. \n \nPro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! (\"Pro Baseball? Murder Case!\") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops. \n \nThis game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.",
