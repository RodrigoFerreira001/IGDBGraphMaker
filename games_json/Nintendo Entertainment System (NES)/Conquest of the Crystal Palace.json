Zap and battle your way through the peaks of Mount Crystal. Find Kim at the astral-mart, she will help you along your way with tools and food needed to make this awesome journey. Step into the Realm of the Guardian, the walkway to impending doom. Acid rain is forecasted by QNN... so keep your eyes on the road ahead. Beware! You will fight the biggest, meanest enemies ever seen on the NES! Investigate the Lair of Hungry Ghosts, gather special weaponry and gold. Enter the Gateway of Flame. Look out! The pathway has disappeared and there's only a moment between you and a sea of lava. These tasks and much more must be accomplished if you wish to regain your rightful throne!",
