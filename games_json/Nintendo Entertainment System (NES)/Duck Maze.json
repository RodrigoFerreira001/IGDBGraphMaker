He needs your help and ingenuity to get through the 20 mind-boggling mazes! Beware of the hidden dangers: the foxes, the traps. But most of all, let those sleeping bulldogs lie. Start your adventure in level 1 and challenge your way through to level 20, or if you are feeling vigorous, go straight into a higher level. But whatever you do, DON'T CRACK THE EGG!",
