    "summary": "1987 was a big year for Capcom, it was the year that mega man came out, and the year that Makai Island ..... didn't. Developed by Capcom, Licensed by Nintendo, this game was never officially released. \n \nThis game was released in japan. but it was never released in the America's. \n \nMakai Island is played by steering a ship in the oceans. \n \nAs you play you can go on different boats and ships, talk to other people, go on land, and even do some missions. This game seems to take a while to start off. But once you get going you'll be hooked. The world map is rather big and confusing, and chances are you will get lost. But i am sure you can find a map somewhere on the internet.",
