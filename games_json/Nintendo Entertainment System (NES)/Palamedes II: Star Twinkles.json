    "summary": "Palamedes II is a puzzle game and, as it sounds, the sequel to an obscure NES puzzler. The object is to throw one of the player\u2019s dice at a die with the same number or one away. When you clear a die, it is added to the player\u2019s poker-like \u201chand\u201d and the bottom of the screen. When you\u2019ve got a winning hand, you can use it clear multiple lines at once. The game has two modes: Mode 1 is a survival mode and Mode 2 is a screen-clear mode.",
