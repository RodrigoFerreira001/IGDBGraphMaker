Dr. Mario (\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068Dr. MARIO Chotto Dr. Mario?),[5] is a Mario action puzzle video game published by Nintendo. The game was released exclusively as a DSiWare title for the Nintendo DSi platform. Dr. Mario Express was first released as a launch title for the DSiWare service in Japan on December 24, 2008, and was released in both North America and PAL regions in 2009. The game was developed by Arika, which had also created Dr. Mario Online Rx for WiiWare. \n \nDr. Mario Express features the general gameplay of earlier Dr. Mario puzzle games, which focus on eliminating colored viruses from the playing field by matching them with colored capsules. Dr. Mario Express received generally positive reviews, but was criticized for offering fewer playable game modes than earlier Dr. Mario titles.",
