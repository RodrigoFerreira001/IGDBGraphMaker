It was the first Saturn demo disc to hit American shores, and was bundled with all new consoles during 1995. \n \nMost likely due to its early release, there aren't actually any playable demos in Sega Saturn Choice Cuts, just gameplay footage of upcoming or recently released titles, along with promotional material.",
