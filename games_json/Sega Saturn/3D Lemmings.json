    "summary": "There is no actual narrative to the game. The only introduction is a movie. It shows a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a \"3D\" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape. Other movies play after completing each set of 20 levels, but are not connected by a storyline.",
