The format of the game is a 2D side-scrolling shooter (much like the original Macross game for the Nintendo Family Computer). The player has two basic attacks: Gun Pod and missiles. In addition, the VF-1 Valkyrie unit controlled by the player can transform into Fighter, Gerwalk and Battroid modes during battle.",
