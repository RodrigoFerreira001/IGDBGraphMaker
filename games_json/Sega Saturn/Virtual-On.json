    "summary": "Get it on with Virtual On! The home port of Sega's arcade hit where you take control of gigantic, fully armored battle droids and duke it out against other droids in duel-like battles over a set of different arenas. \n \nThe game boasts 8 fully polygonal droids, each with his own strengths and weapondry and 10 different arenas with their own layout and traps. Proceed through the entire campaign via subjecting yourself to \"virtual training\" and then facing off for the real thing against the other computer controlled droids, or go against a human opponent in multiplayer combat over Lan, modem, serial link or the same computer with split screen display.",
