        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players help a young boy regain his lost memories. As players traverse around a city, they can identify and interact with ghost-like creatures (Yo-Kai) and use them in turn-based combat against other creatures. Yo-Kai can use various attacks (e.g., punches, sword slashes, magic spells) to drain opponents' life meters; colorful light effects, smacking/zapping sounds, and depleting hit points indicate damage during battles. A handful of sequences also depict violent acts: a cat hit by a truck; a child beaten up by bullies. The game includes several depictions and references to bodily functions: a Yo-Kai called Snotsolong with mucous dripping from its nose; Yo-Kai (Cuttincheez and Cheeksqueek) with buttocks for heads that use flatulence-like attacks; dialogue that states, \u201cIt smells a little like my farts. . .\u201d and \u201cI mean, if it were my farts that had made this smoke. . . You'd have been knocked out!\u201d"
