        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players attempt to save a futuristic world from dragons. As players explore environments and use resources to expand their team, they engage in turn-based battles with human and fantastical enemies (e.g., giant crabs, plants, robots). Players select attack moves/skills/spells from a menu while on-screen characters use swords, guns, or magic to deplete the hit points of their opponents. A handful of attacks result in brief blood splatter on the screen. Some female characters are depicted wearing low-cut tops that reveal large amounts of cleavage; one character's costume reveals large portions of her buttocks. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cas*hole,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in the dialogue."
