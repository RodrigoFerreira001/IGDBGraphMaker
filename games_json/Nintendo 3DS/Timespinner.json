    "summary": "Timespinner is a 2D Metroidvania Platformer for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux. At its heart, the game is a child of the great pixelated classics of the SNES and PS1 age. From the rich story worlds of Star Ocean, the expansive gothic castle exploration in Castlevania, and the tight gameplay of Megaman X, Timespinner seeks to weave all of these elements into one amazing game.",
