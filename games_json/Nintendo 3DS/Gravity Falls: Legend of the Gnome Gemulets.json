    "summary": "Gravity Falls: Legend of the Gnome Gemulets is a side-scrolling platform game. Players assume control of Dipper and Mabel, and they can freely switch between them at any moment during the game. The two characters have different abilities. Dipper can combat enemies with a close-ranged weapon called Gnome Battle Cuffs and look for clues using a flashlight, while Mabel can utilize a grappling hook to reach high grounds, and combat enemies with ranged attacks by her \"Fleece of Bedazzlement-enhanced sweater sleeves\".[1] Players can purchase new items from vendors, and return to the regions they have previously explored, similar to a metroidvania.[2] The game also includes humor based on its own clich\u00e9 story utilized in videogames.",
