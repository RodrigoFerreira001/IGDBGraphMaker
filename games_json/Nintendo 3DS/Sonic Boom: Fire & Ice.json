As players traverse side-scrolling levels, they use elemental powers (e.g., fire, ice) to solve puzzles, collect rings, and battle enemy robots. Players use spin attacks and \"cartoony\" weapons (e.g., boomerangs, hammers) to defeat enemies; enemies break apart amid colorful explosions."

He mines it as a fuel source, piping off the messy by-products of the operation to adjacent islands, creating fire and ice gameplay.

It all culminates with an epic battle on the Island of Ragna Rock where Sonic may just have to save Dr. Eggman from his own creation.\"",
