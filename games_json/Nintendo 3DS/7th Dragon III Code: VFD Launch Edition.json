As the protagonist, the player will team up with Nodens Enterprises-a video game company dedicated to stopping the dragon menace-to become a dragon hunter and eventual savior of the universe. Although times are bleak, Nodens Enterprises has found a way to tip the scales in favor of mankind: By traveling through time to three different eras, the protagonist can upset the balance of the dragons' power. This will give them the edge to defeat the True Dragons, and stand a chance against the most powerful one of them all... the 7th Dragon: VFD. \n \nThe Launch Edition includes a 28 page art book.",
