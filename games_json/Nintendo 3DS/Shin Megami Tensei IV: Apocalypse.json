        "synopsis": "\tThis is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a demon slayer caught in a war between gods and demons in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo. As players explore urban landscapes, they interact with characters and engage in turn-based combat against human enemies and demon-like creatures. Players use a variety of weapon attacks and magic spells from a menu screen to kill enemies. Damage is indicated by impact sounds, colorful light effects, and large explosions. Blood effects are frequently depicted: blood stains on characters' bodies/clothing; large blood stains underneath corpses or in pools on the floor. During the course of the game, some female demons are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples) and exposed buttocks; other demons have phallic-shaped heads and/or torsos. Descriptions of demons sometimes include sexual references: \u201cThey visit sleeping men and have sexual intercourse with them.\u201d The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue."
