    "summary": "Seven adventurers are about to embark on the quest of a lifetime as they explore the island of Avalon and unravel the mysteries of its dark past. The RPG is developed by a core group of legendary developers who came together to create this brand new story and world. Seven adventurers arrive on the mysterious island of Avalon to pursue their own agenda as explorers. They team up with two of the other adventurers to achieve their objectives - be it exploring the island for treasure, looking for the \"god\" on the island, or recovering lost memories. But things change when they discover a singing stone that causes the party to see phantasms of Avalon's forgotten history. \n \nThe Legend of Legacy - Launch Edition includes The Legends of Legacy game for Nintendo 3DS, a 40 page hardcover Artbook, and a 10 track Masashi Hamauzu Original Soundtrack CD.",
