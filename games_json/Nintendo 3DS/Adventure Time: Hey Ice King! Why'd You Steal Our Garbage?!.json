        "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game based on characters from the TV show Adventure Time. Players assume the roles of Finn and Jake, two friends who complete quests in the fantasy Land of Ooo. Players use punches and sword swipes to defeat \u201ccartoony\u201d enemies and boss creatures (e.g., penguins, turtles, rock monsters, a chainsaw-wielding bear). Enemies generally blink and disappear when defeated; one ice creature (resembling a bull) turns into a red blob of indiscernible organs before vanishing in a puff of smoke. Some of the dialogue contains jokey threats and/or comically suggestive banter (e.g., [M]y foot is hungry for Ice King's butt,\u201d \u201c[I] was trying to seduce my crafts teacher . . .\u201d and \u201cI took a vacation with babes recently. My babe stats went up by 4!\u201d)."

    "summary": "Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd you steal our garbage?! is the first video game based on the radical, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network show about two close friends - Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. Players will explore the Land of Ooo and set out on heroic quests, as their favorite characters Finn and Jake, in a unique action adventure experience. Adventure Time show creator Pendleton Ward is also heavily involved with the game creation, including the design of a brand new storyline, concept, and quests. \n \nFinn and Jake wake up one morning to find their trash stolen by the Ice King! Jake couldn't care less about half-eaten bananas, crumpled up math notes, and old chicken diapers - but when the Ice King uses these stolen goods to construct a Garbage Princess, our heroes embark on a fantastical adventure and teach him a lesson! Journey through the Land of Ooo in an offbeat adventure and discover perilous dungeons, unimaginable treasures, the true meaning of friendship, and never-ending fun!",
