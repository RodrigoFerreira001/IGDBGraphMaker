        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game, based on the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona franchise, in which players assume the role of students investigating a mysterious labyrinth at a school. As players explore themed dungeons, they engage in turn-based combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, shadow creatures, evil spirits). Players use blades, crossbows, firearms and Personas (i.e., creatures that enable magical attacks) to defeat enemies; impact sounds and colorful light effects are frequently depicted. Some environments depict large bloodstains on floors/walls; one boss fight depicts blood-splatter effects as players are hit. During the course of the game, several female monsters are depicted with exposed breasts, while other creatures have phallic-shaped heads and torsos. Various Personas (e.g., Succubus, Incubus) have sexual characteristics that are described in text (e.g., \u201cThey visit sleeping men/women and have sexual intercourse with them\u201d). The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cd*ck\u201d are heard in the dialogue. "
