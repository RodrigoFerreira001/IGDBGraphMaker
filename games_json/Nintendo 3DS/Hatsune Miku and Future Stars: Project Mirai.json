    "summary": "Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai is a rhythm game and a spin-off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games. Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. The game features different character designs than the main games and the characters appear as their Nendoroid-style, Super deformed versions. For the game's primary gameplay, its music mode, it uses what it calls the \"Chance Circle System\". Buttons will appear around the border of a circle, and a pointer will appear from the center of the circle extending all the way outside the circle's border. It will then turn in a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner according to the song and when the pointer passes the button, the player has to press the face button on the 3DS. Similar to the series, the player's time accuracy will also be rated on a similar scale and manner that will be displayed on the bottom of the screen. In addition the game does not feature the Edit Mode of the Project DIVA series, while the DIVA Room Mode is replaced by the game's My Room mode whereby players similarly get to interact with their modules in a room.",
