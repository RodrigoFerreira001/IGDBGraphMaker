        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players lead a group of adventurers on a quest to save a town from a monster invasion. From a top-down perspective, players explore labyrinths and battle various fantasy creatures (e.g., giant insects, dragons, carnivorous plants). Players select moves/attacks from a menu-screen of options; characters are briefly shown attacking enemies with swords, staffs, rifles, and magic spells. During the course of the game, some female characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage. The game contains brief references to alcohol (e.g., \u201cNo, it's been a while since I drank that heavily. But you'll never catch me passed out drunk.\u201d). The words \u201cp*ssed off\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in dialogue."

    "storyline": "Behold Aslarga, a beautiful town known for its picturesque scenery, with the Amber Yggdrasil crowning the landscape. The town flourishes thanks to a steady stream of adventurers, all drawn by the mystery dungeons that dot the area.\n\nThe mystery dungeons' structure is as twisted and complex as an anthill, and changes each time an adventurer enters, so only the bravest challenge these maddening labyrinths. They receive a great deal of support from Aslarga, from both its citizens and its government. This includes lessons in exploration given by the Guildmaster, as well as laborers who build forts that serve as front-line bases.\n\nWhy is Aslarga so active in supporting the adventurers? To hear the town provost tell it, it is \"To Prepare for the day of Reckoning...\"", 
    "summary": "\"Far off in the mountains, the small village Aslarga becomes a hub for adventurers looking for fame and fortune from the Mystery Dungeons. But dire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG roguelike developed by ATLUS and Spike Chunsoft. \n \nThe Nintendo 3DS exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey\u2019s vast RPG party and skill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon\u2019s infinitely random dungeon adventures. The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.\"",
