        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a warrior battling evil forces (e.g., soldiers, demons). Battles are depicted from an overhead perspective, with characters moving around a grid while taking turns selecting attack moves from a menu. Attacks are presented in short animated sequences: characters striking each other with swords, lances, axes, and pistols. Cutscenes also depict violent acts: characters stabbing themselves or sacrificing themselves for others (e.g., jumping in the way of an attack). A handful of scenes depict silhouetted splashes of blood or brief mist-like sprays when characters are struck. A handful of female characters are depicted wearing low-cut outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; in one cutscene, the camera (from a first-person perspective) zooms-in on a female character's cleavage."
