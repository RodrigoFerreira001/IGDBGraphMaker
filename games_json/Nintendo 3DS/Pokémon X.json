        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing adventure game in which players pit their collection of small creatures (Pok\u00e9mon) against others to become Pok\u00e9mon League Champion. As players interact with characters in a fantasy setting, they can engage in turn-based battles: selecting attack moves (e.g., Scratch, Earthquake, Electro Ball) from a series of menus. These brief encounters are accompanied by smacking/zapping sounds, blinking/light burst effects, and the depletion of health meters. One Pok\u00e9mon is depicted with mucous dripping from its nose; (e.g., \u201cIt sniffs the snot back...'); a text description for a 'Gastro Acid' move reads 'The user hurls up its stomach acids on the target.'
