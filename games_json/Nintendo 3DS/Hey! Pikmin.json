        "synopsis": "This is a puzzle-platformer in which players assume the role of a space captain navigating an alien planet. From a side-scrolling perspective, players traverse platforms and hazards as groups of \u201cpikmin\u201d aliens follow and assist him with tasks: removing obstacles; navigating chasms, water; battling \"cartoony\" enemies (e.g., ducks, snails, giant plants). Players can toss pikmin repeatedly at enemies to deplete creatures' health meters; enemies close their eyes and slump to the ground when killed. During the course of the game, pikmin are sometimes depicted drowning in water or burning in fire. Boss battles require more prolonged combat, as giant creatures sometimes eat or crush pikmin."
