    "summary": "The story kicks off with Arion Sherwind shocked to discover that the legendary football exploits of Raimon Junior High are suddenly unknown. Where mighty football stadiums once stood, now lie baseball fields. Kids who once kicked a ball in the street now instead busy themselves with basketball, gymnastics, music and calligraphy. In a parallel world where football has ceased to exist, Arion must discover what has happened to the \u2018beautiful game\u2019, tackle the shadowy intentions of El Dorado - the World\u2019s governing council - and face off against time-bending villains in order to restore football to the world.",
