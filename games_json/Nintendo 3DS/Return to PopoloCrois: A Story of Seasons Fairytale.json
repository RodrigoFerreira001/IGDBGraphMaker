        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players follow the story of Pietro, the young prince of the kingdom of Galariland. Players control Pietro and his friends as they explore dungeons, raise animals, tend crops, and battle monsters. Combat is turn-based, with players selecting attack moves or spells from a menu screen. Characters use sword-like weapons and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs) to deplete enemies' health meters. A handful of sequences depict characters dissolving into vapor and/or being absorbed by tentacle creatures. The game includes some suggestive material in the text (e.g., Voluptuous Woman) and dialogue (e.g., \u201c[I]'m sure these ladies would like to have their drills looked over!\u201d \u201cBlack Baron, I want you to look over aaaaall of me!\u201d During the course of the game, bottles and pictures of wine glasses can be seen in the background of a bar; dialogue also references alcohol (e.g., \u201cWhere does he get off talkin' about the royal family bein' finished while he just sits up there drinkin' all day? You can smell that's what he's doin'!\"). The word \u201cdamned\u201d appears in dialogue."

But among them is a very special guest: Marmela, a representative from an otherworldly kingdom called Galariland. Her country has been ravaged by shadowy creatures who corrupt the soil, preventing crops from growing -- and since this same phenomenon has been occurring in PopoloCrois as well, the king now seeks her counsel. \n \nHer expert opinion? Prince Pietro should visit Galariland personally as an ambassador for PopoloCrois, to see the damage first-hand and learn all the ways the Galari people are fighting back. But once he's there, he finds there's no way home, and his princely name holds little sway over the long-suffering people of this new world. \n \nIt is up to you, as Prince Pietro, to make a life for yourself in Galariland while seeking a way home, doing everything you can in the meantime to cultivate the earth and new friendships alike. \n \nA fantastical fairytale adventure awaits!\"",

His ultimate goal is to resurrect the Goddess Galariel so he can drive back the darkness and return to PopoloCrois -- but the road ahead will be a long and difficult one filled with hardships, adventure, farming, robots, wolves, bugs, betrayal, romance, friends both new and old, and a whole lot of fairydust...",
