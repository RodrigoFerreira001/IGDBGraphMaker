The world faced a certain doom. \nAfter tremendous effort, scientists discovered a chance to save their world by acquiring an unknown energy source in another world beyond the \u201cgate.\" \nThe mission to research the new world fell to a young scientist named Frain, in Schutzheim. He threw his body into the \u201cgate\u201d alone. \nThe other world was filled with nature and mystery, things he had never seen. \nBut what really awaited him was treachery and betrayal, by his own world. \nPeople were trampled by machine soldiers, chasers were everywhere, and monsters stood in every avenue of escape\u2026 \nDespite these hardships, though, he found new companions who trusted and supported him. \nAnother-world adventure fantasy RPG on an overwhelming scale!",
