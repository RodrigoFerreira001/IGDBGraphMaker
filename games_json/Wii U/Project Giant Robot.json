    "summary": "Project Giant Robot was a game planned for the Wii U that featured a giant robot that the player could customize and that would be controlled with the Wii U game-pad. \n \nThe idea was to fight other robots and try to knock opponents over like in a sumo match. The Wii U's gyroscope sensor would be used to keep your robot standing during the fight. \n \nThe game had been in development for years and was shown at E3 2014 but development was canceled on February 1st, 2017.",
