        "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a space commander attempting to save humanity from a galaxy-wide threat. As players interact with myriad characters (e.g., developing alliances and relationships), they use machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and futuristic weapons to kill humans and alien creatures in frenetic combat. Enemies sometimes emit splashes of blood when hit; some sequences depict bloodstained characters or environments. Cutscenes depict other instances of violence: an alien shooting herself in the head with a pistol; a character getting impaled by a creature's claws. As the game progresses, the storyline sometimes references sexual material (e.g., \u201cWhen this is over, I'm getting laid\u201d and \u201cWere oil and lubricants involved? Was there moaning?\u201d). Players can also initiate brief romantic encounters between characters: dialogue choices are made, leading to kissing and caressing on a bed\u2014sexual activity is implied. In one of these sequences, an alien character's buttocks and breasts are briefly depicted. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in dialogue."
