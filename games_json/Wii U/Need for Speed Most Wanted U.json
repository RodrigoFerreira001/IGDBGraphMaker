        "synopsis": "This is an arcade-style racing game in which players compete in underground street races with real-world cars. As players speed through a fictional city and perform various stunts (e.g., jumping off ramps, drifting around corners, driving into oncoming traffic), they are sometimes rewarded for forcing other vehicles\u2014including police cruisers\u2014to crash. Collisions are sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects; vehicle damage is indicated by crashing sounds, visible dents, cracked windshields, and/or flying debris. Some racing areas contain signs that depict fictional business names and/or catchphrases with humorous innuendo (e.g., a massage parlor called Roman Hands; a cargo company named GoodsEx); a couple of these signs advertise a distillery and winery."
