        "synopsis": "This is a collection of mini-games (i.e., party games) in which players compete in a variety of board games, cooperative games, and whimsical tasks. Some sequences depict characters performing high-kicks on opponents in a dojo; attack animations are \u201ccartoony\u201d in nature, though include punching sound effects. One mini-game prompts players to zap 'cartoony' aliens in UFOs; another mini-game depicts small tanks firing spiky balls to defeat tank opponents."
