    "summary": "Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R (\u30a4\u30c1\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30eb) is the sequel to Puzzle & Action: Tant-R, and like its prequel is an arcade game released for Sega System C arcade hardware. The game later brought to Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, with the latter being renamed Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R GG (\u30a4\u30c1\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\uff5e\u30eb\uff27\uff27). So far the game has never been released outside of Japan (and South Korea). \n \nLike Tant-R, Ichidant-R is a series of timed minigames, represented in the graphical style seen in Bonanza Bros.. Ichidant-R was bundled with Quiz Rouka ni Tattenasai! in Sega Ages Rouka ni Ichidant-R for the Sega Saturn, and it was also bundled with Tant-R as part of volume 6 in the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. It was also released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007. \n \nOne final game in the Puzzle & Action series, Puzzle & Action: Treasure Hunt was released for Sega Titan Video arcade hardware in 1997.",
