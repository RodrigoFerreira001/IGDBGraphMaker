    "summary": "Yogi Bear has to save Jellystone National Park from an evil ghost named Jake; who stole the funds needed to keep the park operating. There are six different stages in the game that range from a large city to the Wild West. There are no-powerups in the traditional sense; players must collect 100 picnic baskets for an extra life. Hidden doors and areas must be found in order to crack open the safes. Once inside a safe, Yogi must collect 25 gold coins to make a bar. In order to unlock the best ending, Yogi needs to convert 300 gold coins into 12 gold bars that will provide the park with the money to continue operations. \n \nThe player has the ability to jump on most enemies to kill them, just like in Super Mario Bros..Some enemies must be left alone due to the lack of ability to wield a weapon. Falling down into bottomless pits or navigating into dangerous hazards will cause Yogi to lose a life. By default, the player gets three lives and one additional continue.",
