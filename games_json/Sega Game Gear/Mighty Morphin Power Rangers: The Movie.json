    "summary": "The Game Gear version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is a competitive fighting game exactly like the original \"Game Gear\" game based on the TV series, with the same gameplay format and game modes. One change that has been made from the previous is the addition of a thunderbolt-shaped power indicator next to the life gauge that gradually fills up during the course of battle until it begins to flash; during such instances, the player can perform a super move in addition to the standard special moves. The Game Gear version's soundtrack is made up of mostly midi versions of music from the series and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Album: A Rock Adventure.",
