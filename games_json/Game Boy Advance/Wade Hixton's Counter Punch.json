Counter Punch is a non-linear boxing adventure game that lets you star as the dumb witted Wade Hixton. \n \nBut it doesn't end there. On your journey through Big Piney you'll meet the local towns folk, learn new moves, payoff thugs to lend a helping hand a whole lot more. In other words, it be real fun I gar-ron-tee!",
