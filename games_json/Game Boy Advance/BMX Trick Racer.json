    "summary": "Gamers race and rip tricks on 15 street and dirt tracks in unique BMX environments that go through cities, jungles, deserts, mountains, snow and ice. The goal is to rack up as many points as possible with real BMX tricks and a few unreal ones while facing obstacles you won?t find in other BMX games such as ramps, springs and collapsing bridges. In single-player mode, gamers compete against five other bikers who push you to the limit to race like a pro.",
