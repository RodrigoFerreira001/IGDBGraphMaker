But one dark day Skeletor and his evil warriors were able to breach the Mystic Wall. Their relentless attacks have pushed the Masters of the Universe to their edge-and now, yet another wave of attacks. It's clear only one man can protect this land and keep its people safe - He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe! Can you, as He-Man, push back the evil beasts to the Dark Hemisphere? Test your skills and discover if you are worthy of being He-Man.",
