        "synopsis": "This is a 'point-and-click' adventure game in which players assume the role of a reporter and/or an American tourist as they search to find the answers behind a series of mysterious murders. Players travel to different international locations, investigate crime scenes, interview people, and solve puzzles by using clues. One scene depicts a murder victim on the floor with a bullet wound in his chest. A small spot of blood can be seen on his shirt. Other sequences involve characters shooting each other in brief skirmishes on a train and in a cave. Some dialogue contains sexual references (e.g., 'I had an image of a naked [character] wriggling around on it with a young journalist' and '\u2026one of the most infamous adulterers in Europe'), and there are occasional references to drugs (e.g., 'A young man who sought to join the sect was given hashish until he drifted into dreams' and 'The freshest water, the most delicious food and the choicest hash'). Expletives such as 'b*tch' and 'hell' sometimes appear in the dialogue."
