    "summary": "Pocket Meat is an attempt to re-create the massive hit, Super Meat Boy as a GBA game. The developer managed to successfully capture the feel of the first few levels of Super Meat Boy. While the graphical style isn't exactly the same, most of the effects and the actual gameplay is quite exact albeit. It's an excellent port of Super Meat Boy and well worth trying out.",
