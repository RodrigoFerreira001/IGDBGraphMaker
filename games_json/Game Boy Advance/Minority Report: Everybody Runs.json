Everyone thought the system was perfect, until a precrime report lists you as the prime suspect. Now, you're on the run through 40 futuristic levels filled with both human and robot enemies in a mission to clear your name. With an arsenal of weapons, hand-to-hand combat skills, and a Jetpack that allows you to fly through levels, it's up to you to stop an evil conspiracy before it's too late.",
