    "summary": "It's time for a new generation of pilots to take the helm! After the Border Worlds conflict of Wing Commander 4, the galaxy breathes a sigh of relief for peace has come at last. The hero of the Confederation, Colonel Chris Blair, decides to transfer to the Naval Forces. The Confederation decides its time to retire some of the old guard to make room for new hotshot pilots. Lance Casey and his best friend Max Garrett are fresh-from-the-Academy rookies looking to make their mark on the TCS Midway. Just as they are getting comfortable, a distress call from their former enemy, the Kilrathi, makes what would seem a routine mission into something else entirely...\n\nWing Commander 5: Prophecy is the last in a long line of classic space combat simulators. You'll take on the role of Lance Casey as he performs dangerous missions for the Confederacy while on assignment on the TCS Midway. Engage in conversation via glorious late 90s FMV with your fellow crew mates. Match your wits and skill in space combat against an all-new alien threat whose coming was foretold by an ancient Kilrathi prophecy of the end of the universe. Arm yourself with a vast variety of death-dealing weaponry and fight back the enemy!",
