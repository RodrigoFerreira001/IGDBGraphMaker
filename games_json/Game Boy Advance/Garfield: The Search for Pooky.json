The game takes Gar\ufb01eld through his best known haunts interacting with his favorite characters e.g. Jon, Odie and Arlene to name but a few. No cat's tale would be complete without the usual encounters such as: dogs, mice, spiders & scraps of food. \n \nTrue to his character Gar\ufb01eld can not resist eating as much as possible throughout the game but food equals' energy & energy enables this fat cat to perform extraordinary moves throughout his adventures in the game. At the same time all sorts of obstacles will have to be avoided, such as web spinning spiders, happy Odie rushing towards Gar\ufb01eld, bad food, annoying kids, angry pit-bulls and more.",
