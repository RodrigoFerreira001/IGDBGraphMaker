    "summary": "What could be better than an Asterix game? Two Asterix games, of course! Indeed, this extraordinary cartridge designed for GameBoy Advance offers the lucky player two games for the price of one. \n \nAllow us to introduce the one on the right, inspired by Asterix and Cleopatra. Your mission, as you control our two heroes, is to help Edifis with the construction of a palace for Cleopatra. Mainly, you'll be defending him from the vile stratagems of his rival Artifis and Caesar's watchful legions. \n \nIn the game on my left, \"Asterix and Obelix,\" the idea is to bring souvenirs from every country in the Roman Empire to Julius Caesar, who deluded himself into thinking he could confine our indomitable Gauls to their village. Hang onto your helmet as your package tour, eventful as ever, takes you to see the wonders of (Great) Brittany, Helvetia, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Spain.",
