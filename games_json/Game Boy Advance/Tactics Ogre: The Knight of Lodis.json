    "storyline": "\"The island of Ovis, located to the west of the continent of Galicia, has been under the rule of the Holy Lodis Empire for the last 15 years, and its inhabitants have been forced to convert to Lodisism. Although the southern region, Anser, initially resisted subjugation, today it flourishes because of trade with the mainland, and the lives of its people have been enriched. Rananculus, the northern region of Ovis which is surrounded by mountains and forests, accepted the conversion without putting up a fight. At present, inhabitable land is scarce and now only a few aristocrats and civilians live there. Alphonse, the main character of the story and a member of the Order of the Sacred Flame, visits this region to investigate an unusual occurrence. His life will forever be changed from his encounters with the people there.\"",
