    "summary": "This third-person action-adventure game lets you guide the foremost of the Lightning Knights, Ace Lightning, on his mission to defeat the evil Lord Fear and send him and his gang back to prison in the sixth dimension. The only way to capture Lord Fear is to collect all the pieces of the magical Amulet of Zoar, which he has hidden throughout the Carnival of Doom--a scary place full of exaggeratedly imposing tents, rides and sideshows, with distorted geometry and disturbing lighting effects. You must guide Ace Lightning around the eerie halls of the Carnival, and into its four zones--the Ghost Town, Fun Park, Circus and House of Horror--on his great quest to collect the pieces of the Amulet.",
