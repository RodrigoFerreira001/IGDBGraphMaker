    "summary": "From Wkipedia. \n \nSide Pocket 3 (Japanese: \u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\uff13 Hepburn: Saido Poketto 3?) is a Japan-exclusive pocket billiards video game for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Like its predecessor, Side Pocket 2, it features the in-game likeness of a real-life professional pool player. In this case, it's JPBA member, Kyoko Sone.[4] \n \nUnlike the prior installments in the Side Pocket series, Side Pocket 3 renders the pool room environment with 3D polygons. In spite of this, the table can still be viewed in a traditional, top-down fashion. \n \nPlay modes consist of: story mode,[4] training mode, trick game mode,[4] and versus mode. Game variants include: eight ball, nine ball, rotation, 14.1 continuous, bowlliards, cutthroat, three ball, poker, pocket game, mitsudama, and yotsudama.",
