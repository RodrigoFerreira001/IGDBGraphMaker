    "summary": "Rescue Heroes makes its blazing debut on the Game Boy Advance with Rescue Heroes team leader Billy Blazes guiding the way. Boys embark on firefighting adventures as they deploy a variety of gadgets and maneuver vehicles in a race against the flames. Players navigate Billy Blazes to run, jump, swing and dodge past unforeseen dangers. The junior heroes fly Billy Blazes through trees and jet the super firefighter through water to rescue and evacuate hikers, stranded motorists and people trapped in burning buildings. Obstacles and hazards will delay progress, but by exhibiting strong determination, boys can successfully direct Billy Blazes past each heated challenge to ensure that everyone in Sky High Village is saved, and no one gets left behind!",
