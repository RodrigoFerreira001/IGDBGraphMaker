The evil Queen Reptilla plans to trick Kong into becoming her King, using him as her slave to unite the warring clans of Atlantis for her own evil gains. In a race against time, Jason must convince Kong that Queen Reptilla is evil, in the hope that together they can save the islands of Kong and Atlantis and their inhabitants.",
