He has a huge set of ears that he can use for sonar (for figuring out where to go in a level), to fly for a short period of time, or to hit enemies with his signature spin move.\n\nIn the game, he uses Mini Bros. to help him. They all have special abilities that vary. Some can be used for lighting dark areas, some can heal Blender's life, and some do other things.",
