The controls are simple and the basic point of the game is to choose a team and try to win in a tournament against all the other teams. There is a story mode, which is needed to unlock the final team, and a minigame mode. \n \nThe game appears to take place after the Skypiea Arc, as the crew is seen in the beginning wearing their outfits from Skypiea, and the Skypiea arena is the farthest point that the game goes up to.",
