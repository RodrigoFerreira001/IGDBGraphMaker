    "summary": "In Shin Megami Tensei II, players take the role of the gladiator Hawk, who is able to communicate with demons. The gameplay is similar to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei, controlled from a first-person view,and has players exploring dungeons and battle against demons. Players are also able to speak to demons instead of fighting them, and can try to form an alliance with them. They can fuse multiple allied demons together into a single stronger demon; the new demon can \"inherit\" abilities, including ones it would normally be unable to have, from the demons that were used when fusing it. Players are also able to fuse demons with weapons.\n\nDepending on the choices players make throughout the game, the protagonist's alignment changes; the different alignments in the game are \"law\", \"chaos\", and \"neutrality\". This affects the way the plot progresses.",
