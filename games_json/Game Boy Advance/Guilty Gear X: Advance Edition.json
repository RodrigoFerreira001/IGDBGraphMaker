Game controls can be set to 3 or 4-button mode. \n \nIt includes all fighters in arcade game except Robo-Ky. However, Ky Kiske's extra version uses Robo-Ky's \"beta\" moveset.. \n \nThe 3-mode character selection from X Plus is included with this release. Characters can be edited to any colours, but do not inherit black select and gold select powers as in the X Plus game.",
