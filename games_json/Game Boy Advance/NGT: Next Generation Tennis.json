    "summary": "Playing Next Generation Tennis is like playing a match and watching it live on TV at the same time, with slow motion replays, umpire announcements, realistic player behaviour and crowd noise all adding that touch of authenticity. With over 10 game modes (including 4 hidden ones), Next Generation Tennis offers a broad palette of pleasures, from the most classic to the most innovative. \n \nThanks to the help of the teams at Roland Garros and the US Open, who provided exact plans of their stadiums, the development team were able to produce faithfully accurate models of the most famous courts at Roland Garros and the US Open, as well as of 6 other courts with different surfaces (grass, synthetic). The players must prove themselves on the authentic courts of these world-famous tournaments, in front of crowds who react to their performance.",
