As he falls asleep, he starts having some very strange dreams as a result of overeating right before his nap. Each dream is crazier than the last. The player's objective is to help Garfield through this nightmare adventure by guiding him safely through each of his nine lives.", 
    "summary": "The classic comic strip character Garfield is back \u2013 just as fat, lazy and lovable as ever! The cynical orange cat loves lasagne, coffee, and his remote control as well as his owner, the long-suffering Jon Arbuckle and the sweet but dumb dog Odie. One evening just before bed time Garfield goes on one of his beloved eating benders. That night he faces the consequences as he endures a night full of strange dreams. These dreams and, in some case, nightmares, take Garfield and the player on 9 unique adventures based on the cat's 9 \"lives\"!",
