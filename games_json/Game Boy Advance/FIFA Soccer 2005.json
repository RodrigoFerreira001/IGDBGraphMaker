It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a \"light\" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).",
