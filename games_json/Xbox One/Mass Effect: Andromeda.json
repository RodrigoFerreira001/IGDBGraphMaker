        "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players lead humanity to a new home across the galaxy. As players explore various planets, they use futuristic weapons (e.g., laser rifles, Cryo-beams, shotguns) and special abilities (e.g., concussive blasts, telekinetic pushes) to combat hostile alien races. Battles are frenetic, highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and screams of pain; enemies sometimes emit splashes of blood when hit. During the course of the game, the central character can develop relationships with crew members and engage in brief sexual encounters with them. These brief sequences (couplings) depict sensual caresses, sexual moaning, and hip gyrations; characters' breasts and/or buttocks are sometimes exposed for prolonged periods. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB."
