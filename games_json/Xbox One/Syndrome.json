All too suddenly, you discover that most of them are dead, and those still alive are\u2026 changed.\n\nWith Syndrome, Camel 101 takes first person survival horror back to its roots. In the dark confines of the ship, you look for ways to defend yourself. There are a few weapons scattered about, but nowhere near enough ammunition to deal with all the transformed monstrosities.\n\nTo survive and uncover the events that took place while you were asleep, you can\u2019t always face your enemies head on; sometimes hiding and breathing as noiselessly as possible is your best course of action.\n\nCareful resource management is a key part of Syndrome, but so is learning your enemies\u2019 behavior. What will attract their attention? What will give you a few precious seconds to pass by undetected? Take note\u2015each misstep could be deadly.",
