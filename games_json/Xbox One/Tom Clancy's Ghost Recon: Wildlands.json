        "synopsis": "This is an open-world tactical shooter in which players assume the role of a member of an elite special ops military unit. Players are tasked with completing missions and military objectives (e.g., reconnaissance, extraction, assassinations) in order to take down a Bolivian drug cartel. From a third-person perspective, players mostly use stealth attacks and firearms (e.g., machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols) to infiltrate compounds and kill guards, drug lords, and enforcers. Some areas allow players to briefly interrogate enemies while holding them at gunpoint; other areas briefly depict enemies beating and interrogating bound prisoners. A few scenes depict mutilated bodies among large pools of blood; a handful of cutscenes show enemies holding severed heads dripping with blood. The game includes some sexual material: a woman slapping a man in bed while straddling his waist (both figures are clothed); brief photographic images of a woman's breasts. The game includes several drug references in the storyline, and the use of drugs: a man being forced to sniff several lines of cocaine; various images of marijuana and cocaine. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the dialogue."

A surgical, stealthy, lethal approach is the only way to stop the disease at its source. The Ghosts, an elite US Special Forces team, are sent behind enemy lines to wreak havoc, destabilize, and eventually break the alliance between the cartel and the corrupted government. \n \nFacing an almighty enemy in a massive and hostile environment, the Ghosts will need to make critical moral choices and engage in tough battles to complete their mission \u2013 their grittiest and most dangerous operation to date.",
