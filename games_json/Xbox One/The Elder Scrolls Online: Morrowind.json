        "synopsis": "This is a multiplayer online role-playing game in which players assume the role of a warrior in the fantastical world of Morrowind. As players explore open-world environments, they can perform quests and complete various tasks. Characters use swords, axes, maces, and magic attacks (e.g., lightning, fire attacks) to kill human-like and fantastical enemies (e.g., orcs, demons, giant insects, robots). Players engage in melee-style combat, hacking and slashing at enemies; battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and large splashes of blood. Some quests prompt players to assassinate specific characters or creatures; one quest requires players to mount severed creatures' heads onto pikes. Some game environments depict piles of corpses or skeletons hanging from torture devices. Text descriptions or dialogue sometimes contain references to sexual material (e.g., \u201cShe...raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her\u201d; \u201cSex with attractive Nedes was considered casual recreation...\u201d; \u201c[T]here have been instances of intercourse between these 'races,' generally in the nature of rape or magical seduction...\u201d). During the course of the game, alcohol (i.e., wine, mead, ale) can be purchased and consumed by the player's character; one sequence/mission prompts players to engage in a drinking contest that results in the character's blurred vision and slurred speech."
