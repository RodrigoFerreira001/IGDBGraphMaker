        "synopsis": "This is a strategy role-playing game in which players assume the role of mythical characters battling an ancient race of stone warriors. From a 3/4-overhead perspective, players can position characters around a grid-based area to fight enemies in turn-based combat. Players use swords, axes, bows, and magic attacks to defeat enemies. Combat is accompanied by cries of pain and sword-slashing effects. Some attacks result in small blood-splatter effects and dismemberment of characters' limbs; small pools of blood sometimes appear under defeated characters. The game includes text-based sequences involving alcohol;players select various options to advance the narrative (e.g., \u201cYour insistence that the clansmen stay sober does not go over well,\u201d and \u201cIt's Rafnsvartr, the unabashed drunk, staggering toward you, looking not entirely sober.\u201d). The words \u201cb*tch,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in the game."

    "storyline": "The core of the game is a single-player campaign of turn-based combat engagements inspired by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Shining Force, with the player controlling and being able to build up a party of characters with complementing abilities. \n \nAccording to the developers, their aim was to create a \"mature game for adults in the vein of Game of Thrones or The Black Company\". They intend to engage players emotionally by allowing them to build relationships with the game's characters and shape the outcome of the story through an array of conversation choices.[8] The game eschews certain conventions of action-oriented computer role-playing games such as the focus on a young lone hero's story, looting and buying items, or reloading a saved game state after defeat. Instead, the developers intended to tell the story of the player's caravan as a whole, and encourage players to accept and deal with the consequences of any defeats they may encounter.[9] \n \nThe first game in the Saga centers on the return of the Dredge, a warlike race that despises humans led by the Bellower, a nigh invincible Dredge who leads them on a warpath on human and Varl. As a wandering army sent to fight against the Dredge and find a weakness for the Bellower, many difficult decisions are made by the caravan that would shape the fate of both man and Varl.",
