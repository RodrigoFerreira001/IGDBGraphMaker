When he picks up Otto, Albert is imbued with special powers, and the two work together to overcome murderous beasts and lethal puzzles. But Anna appears to Albert in recurring sequences, indicating that what seems like a journey to save the damsel in distress is anything but. Clues during gameplay suggest that Albert might be hiding something from the player and himself.",
