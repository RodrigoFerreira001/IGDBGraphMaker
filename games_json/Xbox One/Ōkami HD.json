        "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a mythical dog (Amaterasu) that attempts to restore peace to the world. From a third-person perspective, players use swords, mirrors, and magic attacks (e.g., brush strokes generating bursts of fire, wind, ice, thunder, water) to defeat human-like enemies (youkai) in melee-style combat. Enemies generally burst into clouds when defeated; some enemies split in half, emitting stylized spurts of blood. A handful of still images depict animals surrounded by large red bloodstains. One sequence depicts a character using a sword to decapitate the heads of a hydra-like monster. The game includes some suggestive material: a woman whose kimono reveals large portions of her buttocks; a sequence in which a bug pops out of a woman's cleavage; a cutscene in which characters observe a woman bathing in a stream; dialogue that states, \"Now you just hold your melons, babe!\" A few cutscenes depict characters drinking from jugs of sake or smoking pipes; Amaterasu can also obtain a variety of sake power-up items. One level contains a dog enemy that uses feces or urine to attack opponents."
