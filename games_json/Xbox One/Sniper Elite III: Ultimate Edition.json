        "synopsis": "This is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of a US Army sniper during World War II. From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, scoped rifles, trip mines, and grenades to kill enemy soldiers and complete mission objectives. Players employ stealth tactics to dispatch enemies from various ranges (e.g., crouching behind rubble to take a shot; sneaking up and stabbing enemies). Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large splashes of blood. Performing accurate shots sometimes triggers a \u201ckill cam,\u201d which follows the bullet in slow motion to its intended target. These sequences depict X-ray views of enemies' bones, ligaments, and organs shattering or bursting apart. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue."
