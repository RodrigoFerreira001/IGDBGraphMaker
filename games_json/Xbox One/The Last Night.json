One where the fight for survival doesn\u2019t mean food and water, but a purpose for living. Human labour and creativity has been rendered obsolete by AI, so people are now defining themselves by what they consume, not what they create. \n \nCharlie is a lower-class citizen who can\u2019t interface with the systems and augmentations of the world around him, due to an accident during his childhood. He\u2019s a citizen of the thriving metropolis and yet he\u2019ll never be a part of it. Then, a chance encounter offers him the chance to be part of something else and take matters into his own hands.", 
    "summary": "Experience a 2D cyberpunk open world, built with 4 unique districts each with distinct architecture, cultures and industries. \n \n+ Action & infiltration gameplay in the great tradition of cinematic platformers. \n+ Travel between districts using taxis, ferries, or monorail while trying to keep low profile. \n+ A diverse, inclusive cast of complex characters to interact with through meaningful, branching dialogue. \n+ Varied gameplay such as driving down epic highways, flying drones, hacking droids to do your dirty work and remain undetected. \n+ Interactive, in-game multiple-choice events .
