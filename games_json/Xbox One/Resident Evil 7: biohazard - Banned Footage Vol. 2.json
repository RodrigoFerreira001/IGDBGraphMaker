    "summary": "Both volumes will also be readily available for players who have purchased either the Deluxe Edition or Season Pass. Each pack includes two banned footage scenarios and an extra mode: Vol. 1 includes \u201cNightmare,\u201d \u201cBedroom\u201d and \u201cEthan Must Die\u201d, while Vol. 2 includes \u201cDaughters\u201d, \u201c21,\u201d and \u201cJack\u2019s 55th Birthday\u201d. All Banned Footage DLC is also available to download on PlayStation 4.  \n  \n  \nDirector of Resident Evil 7 biohazard, Koshi Nakanishi said \u201cResident Evil 7 features a blend of horror, combat and puzzle-solving, so I wanted to use the DLC to explore each of those concepts separately in depth\u201d. \u201cAs with the main game, the found footage tape idea lets us explore things that didn\u2019t happen all in sequence, but rather to different people at different times. So players can start a DLC tape and not be sure where they even are \u2013 and of course, it means the player can die at the end\u201d.",
