        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game, based on the animated South Park TV show, in which players assume the role of a new kid in town embarking on an adventure to uncover an evil criminal element. Players engage in turn-based combat by moving around a grid and selecting attacks from a menu. Players use various weapons (e.g., blades, claws), blasts of energy/ice/lightning, and melee attacks during combat. Blood-splatter effects occur often, and cutscenes occasionally depict \u201ccartoony\u201d dismemberment or decapitation. The game includes several instances of mature humor, racial humor, and sexual material: characters are depicted urinating and defecating; one extended sequence (in a strip club) depicts a character performing a lap dance while emitting flatulence; one scene depicts a towel character performing an obscured sex act on a man in an alley; another scene shows a man watching security monitors and repeatedly reaching for lubrication behind his desk\u2014all sequences are depicted in a cartoony and over-the-top manner. Characters are sometimes depicted nude (e.g., breasts, buttocks, male genitalia). During the course of the game, players can observe characters snorting lines of cocaine, and in one level, players must complete a quest to bring a marijuana prescription to a character. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \"c*nt,\" and \u201csh*t,\u201d and racial epithets (e.g., \"n**ga,\" \"sp*ok\") are heard in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nPlatform: Windows PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One"
