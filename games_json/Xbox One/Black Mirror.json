        "synopsis": "This is an adventure game in which players help a man uncover the circumstances of his father's untimely death. Set in 1920s Scotland, the game allows players to explore a castle, search for clues, and interact with characters and supernatural beings. Some interactions can lead to instances of violence: characters choked to death; a man impaled in the stomach; a man stabbed in the neck. Large blood stains are depicted on the walls and floors in some areas and on characters' bodies. In one sequence, a bound man is stabbed in the heart at an altar, causing blood to flow and pool underneath; another sequence depicts a corpse slumped over a large bowl of animal blood."
