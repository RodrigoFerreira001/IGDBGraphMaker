On December 13, the cinematic content from Star Wars\u2122: The Last Jedi continues with a new planetary map: Crait. The Starfighter Assault map of D'Qar will join as well, plus a new hero ship \u2013 Tallie Lintra's RZ-2 A-wing. Poe Dameron\u2019s T-70 X-wing is also upgraded with a new ability inspired by Star Wars\u2122: The Last Jedi . \n \nIden Versio returns. In Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II Resurrection, you\u2019ll join Commander Iden Versio during the days of the First Order\u2019s rise to power. These new chapters of Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II\u2019s single-player story mode will be available December 13. \n \nYour choice of faction will continue to matter. Throughout December, you'll see your chosen faction's progress reflected in-game, as you fight alongside allies from around the world to swing the tide of battle.",
