You quickly realize that the villain is entangled in a tragic, centuries-old love story, and wants to resurrect his mistress with the girl\u2019s life force. You feel sorry for the pirate, but you have to stop him before it is too late for your daughter\u2026\n\nYou will leave the modern museum quickly, and find your way to rundown pirate settings, all of them three centuries old. Since the time of the golden age of piracy, the locations have become neglected, deserted and overgrown with plants. Full moon, bones laying on the ground, and a skull-shaped rock add to the dark atmosphere of the mysterious island.\nWhat tragic events took place on the island before your arrival? What evil powers can make an old, rotting ship sail? Is the horrifying, undead pirate really as evil as he seems?",
