        "synopsis": "This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Sherlock Holmes as he investigates several crimes. As players progress through each case, they can examine crime scenes, gather evidence/clues, and deduce the identity of the culprit. During some investigations, characters are depicted attacking and killing other characters with knives, guns, and arrows; blood is depicted as they are injured. Blood stains also appear on characters' clothing; some sequences depict corpses lying in pools of blood. During some loading-screen sequences, the central character is depicted smoking a pipe. The game also includes instances of alcohol use (e.g., customers drinking beer in pubs). The word \u201cbastard\u201d is heard in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One)"
