Players use firearms, explosives, flamethrowers, and melee weapons (e.g., swords, buzz saws) to kills waves of mutated zombie creatures. Battles are frenetic with realistic gunfire and large explosions; certain attacks are highlighted by slow-motion effects. Large blood-splatter effects occur frequently as zombies are decapitated and/or dismembered; several environments depict large blood stains amid mutilated bodies. Some zombie creatures are depicted partially nude with exposed buttocks (no genitalia is shown). The word \u201csh*t\u201d is heard in the dialogue."

The Zed outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech\u2019s failed experiments has quickly spread with unstoppable momentum, paralyzing the European Union. Only a month ago, the first Zed outbreak from the original KILLING FLOOR ripped through London; now the specimen clones are everywhere. Civilization is in disarray, communication networks have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe are now focused on self-preservation, the lucky few who survived having gone into hiding. \n \nBut not all have given up hope; a motley group of civilians, soldiers, and mercenaries have banded together to fight the outbreaks from privately funded bases across Europe. When a specimen clone outbreak is detected, the players are sent into Zed-laden hot zones to exterminate all threats using whatever means necessary.",

Just one month after the conclusion of the events in the original Killing Floor, the clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; governments have collapsed, and military forces are gone.",
