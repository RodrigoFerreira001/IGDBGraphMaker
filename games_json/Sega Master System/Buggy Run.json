The upgradable features of the buggy are Tyres (grip), Engine (speed), Suspension (limits bounce), Steering (cornering), Transmission (performance). All the upgrades cost $10,000 for level 2, $30,000 for level 3, and $50,000 for level 4 however the player doesn\u2019t need to get them in order. There are also special upgrades to buy that includes $5000 for a mine (drops behind and if another car hits then it is blown up until reset), $5000 for Nitoro (gives the players car a short speed boost), and $10,000 for extra capacity of special items (starts with 2 slots to a max of 6). Special Items must be used in the order they're placed in the slots.",
