You run, jump, climb and float on balloons to avoid wild animals and collect the super-sized ingredients to bake the Bread of Legend. \n \nBread is a girl with brown hair who always wears an apron and a chef's hat. She wants to become the greatest baker in existence and things such as danger and common sense won't stand in her way! Butter is just a fat boy in a green shirt with blond hair who loves to eat. So he follows Bread everywhere she goes, for food is soon to follow. \n \nIt is Bread's life goal to bake the Bread of Legend. The ingredients are rare and hidden in very dangerous places. Bread sets off without hesitation to collect the ingredients. Butter warns Bread of the dangers, but she doesn't listen. Butter still follows, as his stomach always gets the better of him. \n \nCollect the ingredients from 8 different stages as you go for the high score!",
