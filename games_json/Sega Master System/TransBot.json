And continuous acid rains give the sky an eerie irridescence. You are the only Transbot pilot left from the now defunct regime. So you must battle wave after wave of orbiting debris. To try to get to the notorious Dalaus artificial intelligence computer. Fortunately, your astro-plane can go through 6 different transformations. Turn into a robot warrior and more. By the time you transform, you should be able to penetrate the fortress of Dalaus. And rid the galaxy of her evil influence forever!",
