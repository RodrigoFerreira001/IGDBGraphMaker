This game is so fast it even gives you special techniques like Hang-on and Counter-steering for taking the corners.", 
    "summary": "Hang-On is an arcade game designed by Yu Suzuki and released by Sega in 1985. In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega's \"Super Scaler\" technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. It also introduced a motion-controlled arcade cabinet, where the player's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character's movements on screen, inspiring arcade games that followed and anticipating the modern motion control trend.",
