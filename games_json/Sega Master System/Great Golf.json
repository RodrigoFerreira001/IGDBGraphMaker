So tee-up for some real fun. And remember to play with caution. This championship course has been groomed for a truly competitive challenge. Eighteen holes full of roughs, bunkers and water hazards will put your nerves to a real test. But not to worry. You've got some clever moves to meet the challenge of a \"dog leg\" fairway or a tricky green. So go for a sneaky slice or hard hook to outplay the rest. Winner takes all! FORE!",
