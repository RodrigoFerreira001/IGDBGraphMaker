    "summary": "Game based on the second movie, developed by the makers of Vigilante 8. Shrek is on a journey to meet his in-laws, so Shrek 2 follows his adventure to Far Away Land and the chaos that ensues once Fiona's parents learn that their precious daughter is an ogre -- and is married to the crudest of them all. Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a \"Burro Blast\" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.",
