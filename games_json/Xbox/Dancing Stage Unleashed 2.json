    "summary": "Dancing Stage Unleashed 2 now features a wider range of Xbox Live modes. Via the online system, players can download new tracks, characters and challenge modes, and can also swap specially choreographed dance routines with like-minded fans. There is also an all-new 'Tournament' function wherein up to 8/16 users can participate in online 'dance-offs', with the greatest movers making it to a centrally housed Hall of Fame. Also, players can now play against dancing fans in the US, as well as their European counterparts. \n \nDancing Stage Unleashed 2 includes more than three dozen songs, of which 14 are licensed tracks, each of which is accompanied by its relevant promo video. The tracks in the new game span a range of decades and include 'Where's your head at' by Basement Jaxx and Girls Aloud's 'Love Machine' to cater for pop fans, while the likes of the classic 'Step On' by the Happy Mondays and 'Alright' by Supergrass offer a slice of the indie scene. A couple of true dance classics are also included in the shape of Donna Summer's 'Hot Stuff' and 'A Town Called Malice' by The Jam.",
