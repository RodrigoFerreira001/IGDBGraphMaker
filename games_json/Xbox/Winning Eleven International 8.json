    "summary": "Also available in a European version known as Pro Evolution Soccer 4, Winning Eleven 8 is developed by the legendary soccer expert Shingo Takatsuka. New free kick and penalty techniques can now be used, while an innovative indirect free kick has been implemented to add further variety to set pieces. This level of realism has also been extended to the ways players run, move both on and off the ball, and how they control the ball. A new dribbling system is also available giving more control as players go one-on-one and try to pass opposing players, while player likenesses are also enhanced to match the noticeable individuality of the world's greatest stars. Both international and club players are instantly recognizable due to almost photo-realistic graphics.",
