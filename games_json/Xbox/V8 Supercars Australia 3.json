    "summary": "The game's single player mode is split into 2 primary modes, \"World Tour\" and \"Pro-Career\". In \"World Tour\", the player progresses through 32 tiers of various disciplines, and the player is coached by a man called \"Rick\" via the game's cut-scenes (the cut-scenes can be viewed again via the \"Extras\" menu). \"Pro-Career\" mode is more detailed, with over 150 cups in which to compete. There is also an online mode in which it is possible to unlock series with the online mode of the game. The game allows, and sometimes requires, pit stops during which cars can get new tires, fuel, and repairs.",
