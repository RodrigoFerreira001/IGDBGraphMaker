    "summary": "Sega GT 2002 is the sequel to Wow Entertainment's Racing Game Sega GT, released in Japan late in 2002 as a competitor to the PlayStation 2's highly successful Gran Turismo 3. The game was originally intended to be released for the Dreamcast, but when the Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the game was reprogrammed for the Xbox. Following its initial release as a retail game, it was given away on a disk with Jet Set Radio Future in specially-marked Xbox console packages. Sega released Sega GT Online for the following year, with extra cars and an online facility to be used with the Xbox Live. \n \nSega GT 2002 introduced plenty of innovative features, many of which were later adopted by future games of its kind. \n \nThe game's cover features a Ford GT40 (called a Ford GT in the game), a Ford GT (called a Ford GT Concept in the game), and a Ford GT90.",
