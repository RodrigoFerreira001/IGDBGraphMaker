    "storyline": "The main protagonist, Larry Lovage, is a student at Walnut Log Community College whose purpose is to get on a dating TV show called \"Swingles\". Uma Yasmine, the hostess of the show won't allow Larry in the show until he will prove his seductive wits by obtaining \"tokens of affection\". Sixteen college girls will conveniently be at his disposal. His aging uncle, Larry Laffer, from the original games, provides brief advice and appears at a local bar. Larry also must outsmart a sorority house and a fraternity house, known as Dio, where they recite lines that are actually modified lyrics of Black Sabbath songs. \n \nA brief subplot involves the college's arena football team going against a rival team known as the Maiming Maggots. However, the college's team name is a running gag because it is obscured by objects, only revealing it as Flaming Fa-. The final scene shows the team name is actually the Flaming Fantasticks after the Swingles van leaves the school.",
