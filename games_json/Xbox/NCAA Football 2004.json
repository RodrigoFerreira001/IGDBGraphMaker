The player on the cover is former USC quarterback Carson Palmer. The game is available for play with the N-Gage. Commentators are Brad Nessler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other games with the feature (Madden NFL 2004 and NASCAR Thunder 2004, for example).[1] \n \n \nThe game's gameplay similar to NCAA Football 2003, but with updated player stats and rosters. Players can rename players or create their own college team. If the player named the school after one of the schools in the game, the announcers use its name and fight song in the game. The game features new on-field presentation features such as players walking out of their locker room area and then onto the field behind a group of flag bearers. It also features player touchdown celebrations which can result in a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.[citation needed]",
