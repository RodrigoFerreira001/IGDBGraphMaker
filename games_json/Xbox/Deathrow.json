Deathrow combines the fast gameplay of third-person action games, the intensity of fighting games, and the cooperative team play and gritty roughness of rugby. The object of Deathrow is to win matches by any means necessary, either by scoring as many points as possible before time runs out or by severely injuring your opponents and removing them from the field of combat. Engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat against your friends, enemies, or intelligent AI opponents that don't just get mad--they get even.",
