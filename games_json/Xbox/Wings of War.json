    "summary": "Wings of War is a Flight Simulator developed by Silver Wish Games and published by Gathering of Developers. The game was a standard wartime flight simulator with the underused setting of World War I. Players assume the role of a Royal Air Force pilot fighting the Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte in several missions. Despite its setting, the game still features an arcade style to it: the planes never stalled[citation needed] and the planes could be equipped with air-to-air rockets.",
