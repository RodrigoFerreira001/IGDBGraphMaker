    "summary": "Bloody Roar 3 is a 2000 fighting arcade video game developed by Eighting and Hudson Soft. It is the first of the series to appear on the Sony PlayStation 2. \n \nThe gameplay (the controls) had six different buttons and the commands would be; punch, kick, throw, beast form, and side-step left and right with L2 and R2, which can also be done by double tap down or up to side-step. The main feature is still the ability to transform into beasts, which is involved in all of the Bloody Roar games. Once the character transforms, they regain all the health they have lost and become much stronger and more powerful than befor",
