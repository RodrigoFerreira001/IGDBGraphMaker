    "summary": "Few rivalries in American history evoke stronger emotional reactions than that of the oldest rivalry in American Motorsports \u2013 Ford vs. Chevy. This competition appeals to tens of millions of Ford and Chevy owners and NASCAR racing fans. Ford vs. Chevy takes players to the town of Westington where residents and rivals Tyrone Baker and Eddie Olson got things started way back in the earliest days of motoring by racing their Ford Model T and Chevy 490. Over the years, their rivalry grew and soon other Ford and Chevy owners started to join in the fun. Out of this rivalry, the Westington Cup was born. And so we come to today \u2013 the Westington Cup tournament is about to begin. As a driver for either the Ford or the Chevy team, it\u2019s time to defend your pride as you battle in a variety of different races, missions and vehicles. It's furious fun as you race 48 of the hottest Ford and Chevy cars, trucks and race cars of all time.",
