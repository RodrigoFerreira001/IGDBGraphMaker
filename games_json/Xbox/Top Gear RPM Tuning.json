    "summary": "RPM Tuning (also known as Top Gear RPM Tuning, and Midnight Outlaw: Six Hours To Sun Up for the PC) is a racing video game released in 2004 and was developed by Babylon Software and published Wanadoo Edition. It is part of the Top Gear game series. This is the only installment in the series to not be released in Japan. North America was only able to see an Xbox release. \n \nThe player assumes the role of Vincent Riker, who is trying to avoid being stopped by the police. Around 40 square miles of Los Angeles have been recreated for the game, including streets and parks. \n \nPlayers can customize their vehicles with up to 221,184 possibilities for mechanical parts and 1,382,976 different possibilities for the exterior; the number of accidents a vehicle sustains also affects performance. There are seven game modes, with 54 different missions in the story mode.",
