    "summary": "Total Immersion Racing is a bare-bones rendition of Gran Turismo 3 or Sega GT 2002, albeit without the preponderance of cars and special effects. What's left over is a driving simulation that offers the rich gameplay of these heavy hitters, as well as a graphical show that's nearly on par with them, but none of the frills or splash that would attract casual players in search of a vicarious speed rush. It's a game for people who want to discover what the weekly toil of GT-class competition is really like, who understand that actual racing often entails driving around the same course lap after lap without much fear of hazards or obstacles, and who don't mind that the ultimate reward is the ability to drive a handful of different cars for various teams on tracks located throughout the world.",
