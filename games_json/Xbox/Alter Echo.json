The ship of Nevin and his crew is shot down by Paavo and they crashland on his planet. The EchoPlast, having developed a conscience, asks Nevin to stop Paavo from destroying humanity with the EchoPlast's power. The EchoPlast forms a suit for Nevin to help him.", 
    "summary": "In Alter Echo, interstellar corporations mine a new organic skin called Plast and use it to make biomachines. Nevin, who can physically alter Plast and time itself, discovers that illegal experiments have infected Plast with human consciousness, and now he must fight for survival against a world gone mad. As you battle wave after wave of biomechanical enemies, you can morph between Melee, Gun, and Stealth modes. A Time Dilation system allows players to freeze the action and cue up an unstoppable flurry of moves and special attacks.",
