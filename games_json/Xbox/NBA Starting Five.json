    "summary": "Basketball game from Konami, featuring a large set of options and modes. Exhibition and Quick Start are self-explanatory methods to play against the computer or a friend in a game of one-on-one, while the Season and Playoff modes allow you take your favorite team to the championship through 82 hard-fought games. Trades and Free Agents are in there too, and there are plenty of post-season awards that can be earned for prosperity (including MVP, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player, Sixth Man, and more). And just for good measure, Konami Osaka has even seen fit to throw in a Franchise feature and a Create-A-Player editor.",
