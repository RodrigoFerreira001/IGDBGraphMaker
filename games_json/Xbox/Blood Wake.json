The game was developed by Stormfront Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios. \n \nSet in an Asian-themed fictional world, Blood Wake is a story-driven, mission-based high seas action game in which the player controls a series of small fighting vessels. Some reviewers described its gameplay as \"Twisted Metal on water,\" although its mission-based story line differentiated Blood Wake from Twisted Metal's arena-based gameplay.",
