    "summary": "Future Tactics is an Action-Strategy game based around a turn based battle engine. The game has a single player 'Story Mode', a two player 'Battle Mode'. \n \nThe player controls a team of nine characters. The player must move each of their characters and attack the enemy creatures with each turn. The creatures will then each take a turn to attack the player. This continues until either the player has completed his objective or has been 'killed' by the creatures. \n \nThe players must use their wits and make best use of their characters and the terrain if they are to defeat the creatures \n \nFuture Tactics is a tale of love, loss, redemption, hope... and green, ugly mutants",
