    "storyline": "Mafia is set in the 1930s, between the fall of 1930 through to the end of 1938, during the later part of Prohibition, which ended in 1933. The game is set in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven (loosely based on New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago of the same time period). \n \nThe player takes the role of taxi driver Thomas \"Tommy\" Angelo, who, while trying to make a living on the streets of Lost Heaven as a taxi cab driver, unexpectedly and unwillingly becomes involved in organized crime as a driver and enforcer for the Salieri crime family, led by Don Ennio Salieri.", 
    "summary": "Thomas \"Tommy\" Angelo, a taxi driver living in the 1930s in Lost Heaven (based on San Francisco and Chicago), enters a mafia gang led by Don Salieri and gets mixed up in a storyline including many plots, robberies and assassinations, later deciding to become an informant against the mob. Driven by third-person gunplay, realistic driving mechanics and advanced graphics, Mafia immerses the player into a real-world mobster story. \n \nMafia contains a much bigger city to explore than most video games of the time, with multiple forms of available transport in addition to an expansive countryside. The game received positive reviews for the Windows version, with critics praising the game as a more realistic and serious Grand Theft Auto-styled game.",
