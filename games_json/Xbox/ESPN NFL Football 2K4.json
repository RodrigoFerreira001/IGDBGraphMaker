    "summary": "ESPN NFL Football was released in September 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the only game in the series not featuring 2K in the title; 2K4 was instead regulated to the bottom corner of the box art. The game would expand upon the series' ESPN license, with players receiving reports and highlights from ESPN's Chris Berman and Suzy Kolber. New features were added such as first-person football and \"The Crib', which serves as the players own digital apartment and trophy room.",
