    "summary": "TOCA Race Driver (Pro Race Driver in North America and V8 Supercar: Race Driver in Australia) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters, being part of the TOCA Touring Car series. \n \nThe game took a new direction, since the main game mode featured a plot (leading to the game being labelled as a \"Car-PG\") where the user took on the role of a fictional race driver called Ryan McKane, trying to make a name for himself in a multitude of car championships, all the while under the shadow of his more successful older brother and haunted by the death of his father on the racetrack (as witnessed by Ryan as a child). \n \nDespite this slightly clich\u00e9d script, the racing elements of the game continued to receive positive reviews and the game went straight to number one in the UK game charts. Xbox and PC conversions followed in March 2003, with a further Xbox version released several months later at budget price adding Xbox Live support",
