Sit at the controls of a Veritech fighter, a unique mecha capable of ground-based fighting in robot form. Or have the option to instantaneously change into a fast attack fighter for aerial dog fighting, plus the hybrid Guardian mode that blends some of the strengths and weaknesses of the other two modes. \n \nBattlecry's combination of fast-paced gameplay, freedom of movement, and dramatic storyline make for a unique combat experience.",
