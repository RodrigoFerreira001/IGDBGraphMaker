        "synopsis": "This is a third-person action game in which players assume the role of Milo Burik, an undercover agent who infiltrates a Barcelona crime syndicate while posing as a driver-for-hire. As a wheelman, players drive a variety of cars and motorcycles around an 'open world' environment and perform various driving-based missions. Some missions involve high-speed chases in which players can shoot at or ram into other vehicles (including police cruisers). Players can exit vehicles to engage in on-foot missions, which sometimes involve frenetic gunfights against enemies. While players can kill gang members and thugs, pedestrians and innocent parties cannot be killed or noticeably injured. Players can also shoot at police officers who attempt to apprehend the player when non-adversaries are attacked. Some cutscenes elaborate on story elements and introduce a variety of characters and settings. One setting is a gentlemen's club in which a provocatively dressed woman is seen dancing on a pole. Characters also make occasional references to prostitution and sex (e.g., 'Yes, what a rush, eh? Como sexo fantastico [Like fantastic sex]'). Dialogue also contains profanity in both English (e.g., 'sh*t' and 'a*shole') and Spanish (e.g., 'p*ndejo,' and 'm*erda')."

While most missions are driving-oriented, there are also foot missions which are played from a third person perspective. A wide variety of weapons are available to the player, such as pistols and RPGs. \n \nAmong the vehicles used by Milo Burik in the game is the Pontiac G8,[2] shown in released trailers for Wheelman. Reports[3] also indicated that the Opel Astra is a drivable vehicle. In the demo, his license plate says MRTL KM8T which is a reference to Mortal Kombat, Midway's popular fighting game.",
