        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players control a young goddess on a quest to return home from an alternate dimension. As players advance the storyline, they use swords, lances, guns, and colorful light attacks against fantasy creatures (e.g., plants monsters, dragons, robots). Combat is turn-based, and damage is indicated by impact sounds and a loss of hit points. During the course of the game, some female characters are dressed in low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and/or buttocks; one bathing sequence depicts female bodies partially obscured by hot-spring mist and soap suds. Characters also make several suggestive/sexual comments (e.g., \u201cAre those boobies? Mine get big when I transform\u201d \u201cWait, is she a dominatrix\u2026?\u201d \u201cI'm sorry for all the foreplay\u201d and \u201cEven if you get groped a bit, or get into some kinky stuff, you'll end up able to transform.\u201d). The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ca*shole,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in the dialogue."
