        "synopsis": "In this role-playing game, players control Chou-Chou, an \u201cundisputed god\u201d attempting to forcibly take over her universe. As players explore the solar system, they can engage in turn-based combat with human-like characters and fantasy creatures. Players choose weapon strikes and special attacks from a menu screen (e.g., Rainbow Tower, Two-Part Cut); damage is indicated by slashing sounds, light effects, and a loss of hit points. A number of cutscenes depict female characters whose bodies are partially obscured by hot-spring mist and soap suds. During one such scene, a nearby male character suffers a nosebleed, resulting in exaggerated blood effects (e.g., \u201cThere it goes! The Red Ryuto Geyser!\u201d). Players can also access gallery images depicting women in revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage/buttocks. The dialogue and on-screen text include several instances of sexual innuendo/references (e.g., \u201cWhat if he wrote about his weird habits or sexual fantasies or something,\u201d \u201cCC Sadist,\u201d \u201cI'm just a perverted girl who likes verbal abuse. Please scold me,\u201d and \u201cMarina, lemme grab your boobies.\u201d). The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d also appear in dialogue."

The main protagonist of Mugen Souls, Chou-Chou, plans to conquer the universe by subjugating the seven worlds it comprises, as she thinks the planets look pretty. Gameplay revolves around exploration and turn-based, open-field combat, and the game also includes mini games and customization. Due to the questionable nature of the game's portrayal of child protagonists, certain aspects of the western release have been edited and some mini-games have been disabled.",
