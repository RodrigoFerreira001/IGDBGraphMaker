        "synopsis": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a Spartan warrior battling an assortment of fantasy creatures. Players use double-chained blades, swords, hammers, and other weapons to hack and slash at enemies (e.g., zombie-like soldiers, snake creatures, giant insect-statues, monsters from Greek mythology). Combat is frenetic, and blood-splatter effects occur frequently; violent depictions include characters getting stabbed, ripped apart, and sliced in half. Some attacks result in enemies' entrails spilling out. During boss battles, players engage in close-up, extended combat, which is completed by a sequence of prompted button presses; these scenes also include depictions of decapitation and dismemberment. The game includes some suggestive/sexual material: female enemies are sometimes depicted topless; one sequence depicts topless women caressing each other, while addressing the central character (e.g., \u201cGlory to Eros, he has given us a champion. . .come champion, show me your strength\u201d)."

Six months have passed since Kratos stood over the bodies of his wife and child, his hands stained with their blood - tricked by Ares into murdering the only people he ever loved. Swearing to avenge them, Kratos broke the blood oath that bound him to Ares, but oaths to Olympus are not so easily broken... Sentenced to an eternity chained within a prison for the living damned, Kratos battles insanity at the hands of the Furies. He will be tested as he seeks freedom, redemption for his sins, and the clarity to avenge his family.",
