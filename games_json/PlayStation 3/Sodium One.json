    "summary": "Sodium was a massively multiplayer online game that was based in and exclusive to the PlayStation 3's online community-based social gaming network PlayStation Home. Sodium was a planned four-part series of games, only two of which were released by the time of Home's closure. It was developed by Outso, a developing company that developed spaces and content for Home, and it was published by Lockwood Publishing, who had published other content for Home. The first part, Sodium One, was released on December 17, 2009 to the European and North American versions of Home.[1] It was later released in the Japanese and Asian versions on June 17, 2010 and July 29, 2010 respectively. The second part, Sodium 2: Project Velocity, was released on June 16, 2011 to the European and North American versions of Home.[2] \n \nDue to the nature of Home, the game continued to grow and expand as Home did. New games, virtual items, and community events were continually added until November 2014 when new content ceased to be published for Home, and Home closed on March 31, 2015.[3]",
