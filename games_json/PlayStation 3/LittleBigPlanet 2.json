As players run and jump through levels and avoid obstacles (e.g., flame-throwing turrets, electrified platforms), they can user their helmet to fire rockets, water, and cake at enemies called \"meanies.\" Meanies break apart and disappear in puffs of smoke when defeated. In one level, doll characters can be seen smacking one another to the ground. Players can also customize some levels by assigning burp and flatulence sound effects to various objects."

An inter-dimensional vacuum cleaner called the Negativitron appears over the skies of LittleBigPlanet and begins to suck up its inhabitants, including Sackboy. Larry Da Vinci (Robbie Stevens[9]), the leader of a semi-secret semi-organised group known as \"The Alliance\", comes to Sackboy's rescue, saving him from the Negativitron (Jeremy Mayne[9]). The organisation is dedicated to battling with the Negativitron and defeating it before it destroys Craftworld (Alternate name for game's environment).[7] After Sackboy passes the tests in Larry's Hideout, he tells him that they must get to Victoria Von Bathysphere's (Judy Sweeney[9]) Laboratory, since she has built a Sackbot army for the Alliance.",
