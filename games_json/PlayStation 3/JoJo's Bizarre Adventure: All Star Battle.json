        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players battle each other using the characters from the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Players punch, kick, and throw each other around a variety of environments in attempts to deplete their opponents' health meters. Some characters use weapons such as pistols, machine guns, and swords. Characters can perform several \u201cover-the-top\u201d attacks to injure their opponents, including flattening an opponent with a steamroller. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain and occasional splashes of black blood-splatter effects. One female character can taunt opponents by wiggling her buttocks and making suggestive comments (e.g., \u201cHas anyone ever given you their panties? It's good luck, you know!\u201d \u201cHere! Take my panties! Take them already!\u201d). During the course of the game, one character is frequently depicted smoking a cigarette. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cbastard,\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in the dialogue."
