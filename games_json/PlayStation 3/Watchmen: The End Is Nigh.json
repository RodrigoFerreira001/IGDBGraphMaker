        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players control one of two characters (Rorschach and/or Nite Owl) who explore environments and engage in hand-to-hand combat with several enemies. Players can use weapons such as crowbars, baseball bats, and knives to kill various bikers, gang members, and thugs. Players can trigger close-up, slow motion attacks that often result in bones snapping or enemies getting stunned. Punches and melee attacks frequently cause splashes of red blood to fly through the air, while floors/walls are sometimes stained with pools of blood. During the course of the game, players must track down a villain who has molested an actress appearing in a pornography film. The search leads players to a strip club that contains go-go dancers in cages, peep-show booths, and a pornographic film playing in the background. Moaning and suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'Ohhh, it's so big!') can be heard echoing from the film. Some strong profanity (e.g., 'f*ck' and 'sh*t') can also be heard in the dialogue. The game features supplemental videos detailing the history of the Watchmen franchise, including scenes from the movie. The character Dr. Manhattan, a blue-skinned superhero, is sometimes depicted without clothes (e.g., exposed buttocks, brief full frontal nudity). Another scene from the movie depicts Dr. Manhattan using telekinesis to blow up a group of Vietnamese soldiers. The soldiers explode in front of the camera, though most of the blood and gore is stylized to appear black and viscous."

The city needs saviors and only masked vigilantes will answer the call. Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2 delves further into the partnership of Rorschach and Nite Owl before the hero-banning Keene Act. \n \nIn Part 2, Rorschach contacts Nite Owl to get his help in solving the case of a missing girl, Violet Greene. Along the way Rorschach uncovers that a woman from his past is involved with the disappearance, leading to a conflict of interest between the partners. New Installment of Watchmen Mythology: Set more than a decade before the events of the feature film, the two long-form, episodic video games help to develop the backstory between Nite Owl and Rorschach and leads fans right into the film.",
