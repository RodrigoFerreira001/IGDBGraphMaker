        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles using human characters and biological weapons called GEARs. Players punch, kick, and use various weapons (e.g., swords, chain scythes, giant scalpels) to drain opponents' life meters. Characters can perform super attacks in which opponents are struck by fiery blasts, shot out of cannons, and electrocuted by lightning. Combat is accompanied by sword slashes, cries of pain, and large explosions. One cutscene depicts a character getting impaled by spikes, resulting in blood-splatter effects and his arm ripping apart. The game includes some suggestive/sexual depictions (e.g., camera angles that focus on breasts/cleavage) and dialogue (e.g., \u201c3-on-1 wouldn't even describe what just happened. . . this is like a gangbang,\u201d \u201c...this thing's not a toy, and even if it was it's an adult toy,\u201d and \u201cFarewell. . .virginity. . .\u201d ). During the course of the game, a character is frequently depicted smoking a pipe during matches; one sequence depicts characters discussing and consuming whiskey. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d are heard in the dialogue."
