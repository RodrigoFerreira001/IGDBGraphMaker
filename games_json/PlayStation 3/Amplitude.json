    "storyline": "In 2112, Nanotechnologists at the Applied Meta-Prionics Limbic Tuning Department will create organic machines that can be inserted into the human brain to access both the physical and metaphysical secrets within. In an attempt to induce synesthesia, a \u201cgift\u201d that one of the technologists has, Mari programs a new batch of bots to enter her mind and unlock this enhanced visual/aural perception. This deluge of imagery and sound is overwhelming and unfortunately, Mari\u2019s brain shuts down. You will use the AMPLITUDE Operating System to enter Mari\u2019s memories, senses and emotions. There you will blast away the protective scarification that her brain has created around these synesthetic senses and bring her back to life.", 
    "summary": "Amplitude is a reboot of the critically-acclaimed controller-based rhythm action game developed by Harmonix and originally released in 2003\n\nAmplitude features over 20 songs composed for an optimal beatmatching experience by Harmonix with contributions from Freezepop, Danny B, Jim Guthrie, and more. Many of the developers from the original game are actively working on the reboot.\n\nThe new Amplitude will be treated like a classic, sci-fi concept album. There is a narrative that runs through the game and surfaces in many ways through the visuals, music and song lyrics. \n\nPlayers will speed down long, winding paths made up of the different musical elements of a song. Each track is differentiated with the musical sounds of synthesizers, drums, vocals, and bass. As players blast away the patterns of gems on these tracks, they release musical energy and recreate the hidden song within.\n\nGameplay remains easy to pick up and difficult to master. Achieving a top score will be a challenge and therefore worth bragging about via online leaderboards.\n\nAmplitude supports up to four players locally. Challenge your friends and use devastating power-ups during frenetic multiplayer matches to secure your place at the top.",
