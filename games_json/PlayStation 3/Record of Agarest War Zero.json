        "synopsis": "This is a fantasy role-playing game in which players control a hero and his troops through a span of two generations. Players explore towns, travel along map points, and fight humans and creatures in turn-based battle. Combat consists of small characters standing in place as players select weapons and attacks (Trick Hit, Black Mist, Shadow Burn, etc.) from a menu screen; damage is indicated by various slashing sounds, light effects, and floating hit points rising above characters' heads. The game depicts several female characters whose breasts/buttocks are partially obscured by towels, hot-spring mist, blankets, and skimpy costumes. These still-frame images also depict female characters holding each other provocatively or engaging in suggestive/sexual dialogue (e.g., 'I'll teach you how to please a man' and '[W]hy are you touching me?!'/'Not . . . there . . . Ooooohhh! Please, go easy on me!'). In one extended sequence, female characters in a hot spring compare each others' bust sizes (e.g.,'She is a grown woman now,' 'Such courage, to so brazenly flout the laws of gravity' and 'Yours are just as large, Mimel!'). During the course of the game, characters make several references to alcohol (e.g., 'She shall make an excellent drinking partner,' 'We might drink hot buttered rum,' and 'Barkeep, bring us some more fresh ale!'). Language such as 'bastard' and 'damn' can be heard in dialogue."
