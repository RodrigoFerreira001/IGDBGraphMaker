        "synopsis": "This is a rhythm game in which players tap buttons in time with music videos starring a variety of animated characters. Players score points by accurately matching timed cues as they appear on screen. Some scenes depict female characters wearing short skirts, revealing tops, and dancing provocatively; one character is shown wearing an outfit in which her chest is covered solely by two belts. One video contains a brief shot of a silhouetted girl being impaled by a large sewing needle. Some song lyrics, which are in Japanese, contain brief references to suggestive material (e.g., \u201c[H]er flat chest isn't going to do much justice to my costume;\u201d \u201cI'm showing too much cleavage? You know you like it\u201d)."

    "summary": "Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F is a rhythm game and the fifth entry in the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games. It was also the first game in the Project DIVA series to be released in the West. Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Hatsune Miku. The game retains the same basic gameplay mechanics from the series albeit with several new changes, most notably the addition of the \"Star\" symbol to the game's existing symbols of cross, circle, square, triangle and arrows. The \"Star\" symbol represents the \"Scratch\" move where instead of pressing the face buttons as usual, players rub the screen or flick the analogue stick, depending on which system is being used. \"Chance Time\" has been modified from previous installments, with each successful beat filling a star shaped gauge on the bottom left of the screen. When filled, it triggers a final scratch symbol that, if successfully scored, will change the outcome of the scene. Another new mechanic is the \"Technical Zone\" mechanic. When it occurs during a song, players must maintain an uninterrupted combo within that time limit for bonus points.",
