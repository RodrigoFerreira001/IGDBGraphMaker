The story in THE iDOLM@STER 2 is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of leading and training a group of three pop idols to stardom and receive music awards. Its gameplay, while remaining similar to the previous title, features several improvements and differences, including changes in the roster of idol characters and the removal of online multiplayer elements. At the beginning of the game, the player meets the president of 765 Production and is tasked with creating a unit of three idols from nine of the agency's members. The player and the selected idols are also tasked by him to become nominated to the Idol Academy music awards festival and win awards within 52 weeks.",
