Still-frame cutscenes sometimes show characters attacking and killing enemies with swords and slashing attacks; blood is sometimes depicted staining characters' clothing. The game also contains some suggestive material: bikini-clad women in suggestive poses (e.g., on knees, bending over); female characters nearly topless (e.g., steam, bright lights obscuring detail) or with their buttocks exposed; dialogue such as \u201cWait, why are you touching me there?\u201d The word \u201cf**k\u201d can be heard in dialogue."
