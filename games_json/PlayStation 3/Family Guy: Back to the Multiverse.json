        "synopsis": "This is an action game based on characters from the TV show Family Guy. Players assume the role of Brian and Stewie, two friends attempting to save their world from Stewie's nemesis. As players complete missions in alternate Family Guy universes, they use machine guns, shotguns, freeze rays, and other firearms to kill cartoon-like adversaries (e.g., fraternity brothers, pirates, alien chickens, Amish townsfolk) in frenetic combat. Players can also pick up golf clubs, bottles, cattle prods, and guitars to use as melee weapons. Other attacks include dirty diaper grenades and flatulence clouds; some attack moves cause nearby enemies to projectile vomit. Though depicted in a \u201ccartoony\u201d art style, battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. In one level, players can shoot physically handicapped adversaries (wearing arm/leg braces) and battle a robot-like boss comprised of wheelchair-bound individuals (i.e., Crippletron). As players progress, the dialogue frequently references sexual material (e.g., allusions to masturbation; oral sex; sexually transmitted diseases; prostitution). Other instances of mature humor include a dancing male character (his buttocks is fully exposed); a man requesting sex while dressed like a baby; signs or objects containing sexual innuendo (e.g., Angela's A*ses, \u201cFor a good time call toothless Annie\u201d); an advertisement depicting fecal matter on a proctologist's finger. Some scenes reference cocaine use; a couple sequences portray vehicles with smoke billowing out the windows (marijuana use is implied); one cutscene depicts a college student smoking from a bong. The words \u201cd*ck\u201d and \u201cp*ssy\u201d appear in the dialogue, along with jokes referencing racial/ethnic stereotypes (e.g., \u201cI feel like it's good to be some Asians, but not good to be most Asians,\u201d\"Oh, no, it wasn't me.  It was that other black guy!\"\u201cWho needs Mexicans when you've got the Amish to build stuff?\u201d)."
