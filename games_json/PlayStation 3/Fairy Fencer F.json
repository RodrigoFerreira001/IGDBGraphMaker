        "synopsis": "This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a young fighter battling enemy forces. As players explore dungeon environments, they interact with characters and battle enemies in turn-based combat. Players select various attack moves from a menu screen; characters use magical sword-like weapons against fantastical creatures (e.g., dragons) and human enemies. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, mostly in still images: characters impaled by swords, spikes, lances; blood trickling from characters' mouths or dotting the screen. During the course of the game, some female characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; a handful of scenes include suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cMy boobs are way bigger than yours are,\u201d \u201cIt is pointless for you to stick out your chest and shove your breasts in my face. And keep your hands to yourself!\u201d). One scene depicts a goddess character's armor breaking apart and exposing her breasts. The words \u201cb*tch,\u201d \u201cbastard,\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in the dialogue."

    "storyline": "A long time ago there was a conflict between a goddess and an evil god. The two deities didn\u2019t fight directly, but created a large number of special weapons for others to use. Eventually, these powers sealed each other and the power vanished from the world. Fast forward to modern times where these leftover weapons are called \"Furies\" and warriors that wield them are \"Fencers.\" Fury weapons are said to be incredibly powerful, so Fencers constantly scramble to acquire them. By a strange coincidence, two fencers, Fang and Tiara, get caught up in the struggle between the goddess and evil god.", 
    "summary": "Fairy Fencer F is a fantasy role-playing game under Compile Heart's Galapagos RPG brand for the PlayStation 3. It features Yoshitaka Amano as a concept artist, Nobuo Uematsu as a composer, Tsunako as a character designer, Toshiki Inoue as a screen writer and the \"Neptunia Team\" as some of the development team.
