        "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a magician named Magus as he navigates his god-like powers. Along with a fellow warrior named Kinna, players explore dungeons and landscapes while battling a variety of humans and creatures (e.g., centaur-like unicorns, skeletons, ogres). Players use swords and magic spells (e.g., fireballs) to attack various enemies. Combat is highlighted by slashing sounds, cries of pain, and splashes of blood to indicate successful hits. One dungeon level depicts several bloodstained walls. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in the dialogue."
