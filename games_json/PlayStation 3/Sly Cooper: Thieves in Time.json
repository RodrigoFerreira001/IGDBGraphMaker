        "synopsis": "This is an action game in which players assume the role of Sly Cooper, a master thief on a quest through time to save his clan's legacy. Players control Sly and his friends as they run and jump through levels, using melee attacks (e.g., bouncing on enemies' heads) and various weapons (e.g., swords, stun guns, oversized bombs) to defeat whimsical animals. Fighting sequences include occasional gunfire effects; enemies generally disappear amid puffs of smoke/scattered coins. One prison scene depicts machines that continuously tickle, slap, and kick restrained characters. During the course of the game, a handful of female characters are dressed in outfits that expose moderate cleavage. One mini-game depicts a hippo dancing suggestively for nearby soldiers; another sequence requires players' character (a female fox) to distract enemy guards with her dance moves (\u201cShake it!\u201d and \u201cMove that thing!\u201d can be heard in the background). An Old West-themed level depicts barrels/bottles labeled \u201chooch\u201d and \u201cXXX.\u201d One boss character is portrayed with a lit cigar in his mouth."
