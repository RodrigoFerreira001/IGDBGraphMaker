    "summary": "Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories was to be the fourth installment of the Zettai Zetsumei Toshi series. Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories would have supported 3D output and PlayStation Move. Initially, the game was planned for release on March 10, 2011, a day before the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, but was pushed back to a Spring time frame. Chief producer, Kazuma Kujo said the reason for the delay was because the game could not be completed in time. The game was officially cancelled on March 14, 2011.\n\nIn December 2014, Kujo revealed that his new company, Granzella, had acquired the intellectual property of the Zettai Zetsumei Toshi series; they plan to formally announce the game in Q3/Q4 2015.\nThe new game was eventually announced in November, 2015 with the title Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4 Plus: Summer Memories. It is being developed exclusively for PlayStation 4.",
