As players travel through time, they use a bladed whip and swords to kill human and fantasy creatures (e.g., vampires, demons, ghouls). Several enemies use machine guns against players during combat. In some sequences, players can stab creatures repeatedly, cutting off limbs or tearing enemies apart. Intense instances of violence include depictions of a demon cutting off a man's face; ghouls eating pieces of flesh; a character getting a stake driven into her head. During the course of the game, some female creatures (e.g., demons) appear topless with jiggling breasts. The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in the dialogue."

He has been warned by Zobek of the return of Satan and sets out to regain his powers so that he may face Satan once again. The key to him regaining his power lies in his castle. However, the famed Belmont clan and his son Alucard seek his ultimate destruction.", 
    "summary": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game and a sequel to the 2010 game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 35th installment on the Castlevania franchise. The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.",
