        "synopsis": "This is an adventure game based on the Walking Dead TV and comic-book franchise. Players assume the role of Lee Everett as he leads a group of survivors through Georgia during a zombie outbreak. As players progress through the story, they are presented with dialogue and action choices. These selections can sometimes lead to the death of characters and sequences that depict intense violence: a woman shooting herself in the head; a man's leg getting amputated with an ax; a man cutting off his own arm; zombies attacking, disemboweling victims. In some sequences, players use realistic firearms or other objects (e.g., hammer and pitchfork) to kill zombies and other human survivors. These sequences are sometimes accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood. Blood-splatter effects also appear in the surrounding environment and around several corpses. The game contains some suggestive material in the dialogue (e.g., \u201cMight as well leave a sign out that reads, 'The men are out, come rape our women and children'\u201d); in one sequence, a video depicts a man zipping up his pants and a woman buttoning up her blouse. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in dialogue."
