        "synopsis": "This is an adventure game in which players follow the exploits of the pirate Guybrush Threepwood as he attempts to find the hidden treasure of \"Big Whoop.\" Players explore various islands, solve puzzles to complete quests, and can interact with irreverent characters throughout. Instead of actually engaging in combat, Guybrush attacks some characters by poking and prodding \"cartoony\" voodoo dolls. In one scene he rips off the leg of a voodoo doll, causing a zombie pirate to lose his arm and leg and spew out splashes of green blood. To solve one of the puzzles, players must compete in a drinking contest during which a character is depicted drinking a mug of grog. The grog is described as having \"twice the alcohol, twice the calories,\" and causes the character to pass out. There is also a scene that depicts a man spitting out green mucus, and players can compete in a spitting contest. The word \"hell\" can be heard once in the dialogue (\"What the hell?\")."
