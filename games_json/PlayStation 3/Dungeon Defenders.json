        "synopsis": "This is a tower-defense role-playing game in which players protect a variety of castle environments from waves of cartoon-like fantasy creatures. Players can use missile launchers, magic barriers, fireball towers, and harpoon turrets to repel a variety of enemies (e.g., goblins, trolls, and dragons). Injured enemies grunt and sometimes emit spurts of green or pink fluid. Battles are sometimes highlighted by hand-to-hand combat in which characters use swords, bows, or spells against each other. One tavern setting depicts frothy mugs and pitchers."
