Set across stages including the Middle East and South America, the now aged Snake has been asked to assassinate his old adversary, Liquid Ocelot. \n \nTo do this, however, he must make his way through a series of battlefields, using his legendary stealth abilities and all-new OctoCamo suit to avoid detection and to reach his target. With series favorites such as Meryl Silverburgh, Raiden, Hal 'Otacon' Emmerich, Eva and Roy Campbell returning, and with all new gameplay features including a remote-controlled Metal Gear Mk. II and enhanced CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system, Metal Gear Solid 4 rounds out the Metal Gear saga with a fittingly cinematic and gripping final outing. \n \nThe Limited Edition (available exclusively at certain retailers) comes packaged in a collectible metal case and includes a Blu-Ray video containing \"making of\" documentaries and an extensive interview with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. \n \nAlso featured is the Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots Soundtrack CD.
