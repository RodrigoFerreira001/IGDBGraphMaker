    "summary": "The afterlife adventures of reluctant Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki make their high-def video game debut in the PlayStation 3-exclusive Bleach: Soul Resurrecci\u00f3n. Gamers can role-play through re-creations of their favorite plotlines from the Bleach comics and cartoon series, or seek out new side-adventures in the freely roamed game world, stocked with random encounters and fan-friendly details. Cel-shaded graphics add interactive depth, in the anime's distinctive visual style. In addition to Ichigo, gamers may play through the mission-driven stories of 20 other characters from the popular manga and animated series. By choosing which new powers and abilities to unlock, characters can be custom-developed as they earn experience. The combat-centric action involves super-human swordplay and supernatural powers, and battles sometimes develop Dynasty Warriors-style odds, as the player's lone hero must aggressively fend through deluges of enemy opponents. The game's Mission Mode offers a goal-oriented alternative to the Story Mode's character-based campaigns.",
