        "synopsis": "This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles with characters from the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona franchise. Players punch, kick, and use a variety of weapons/magical attacks (e.g., machine guns, giant axes, electrical bursts) to drain opponents' health in melee-style combat. Matches are highlighted by battle cries, impact sounds, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground; one stage depicts red blood splatter in the background. Some cutscenes include suggestive remarks (e.g., \u201cI request that Miss President try to score with me,\u201d \u201cHis nurse magazine, with chest examinations and bear behinds,\u201d and \u201cI'm against girls binding their breasts like this.\u201d). Throughout the game, one recurring character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cb*tch,\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d can be heard in the dialogue. "
