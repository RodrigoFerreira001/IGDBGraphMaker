        "synopsis": "Players assume the role of an aspiring pirate in this irreverent 'point-and-click' adventure game. Players explore the environment, solve puzzles, and 'verbally joust' with characters in an attempt to save a woman in peril. The game includes several comical depictions of characters, including a scene in which a 'Meathook' character turns his back to the camera to reveal a slightly exposed buttocks (e.g., 'plumber's crack'). During a sword fight, one of the characters uses a suggestive metaphor to describe battle (e.g., 'Sword fighting is kinda like making love. It's not always what you do, it's what you say.'). While players have no direct control over the sword combat, they can sometimes make/hear comments such as 'prepare to die' and 'I will milk every drop of blood from your body.' One character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth, and another character discusses how rum is an ingredient in a grog mixture. "

    "summary": "Relive the swashbuckling humorous misadventures of the wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood! \n \nBack by popular demand, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition faithfully re-imagines the internationally-acclaimed classic game (originally released in 1990) for original and new audiences alike. The development team at LucasArts is bringing the game into the modern era with an all new re-imagined contemporary art style, a re-mastered musical score, full voiceover, and an in-depth hint system to help players through the game\u2019s side-splitting puzzles. Purists will also delight in the ability to seamlessly switch between the updated hand-drawn re-imagining and the original classic version. \n \nThe game's twisty plot leads our naive hero on a hilarious, swash-buckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island. Tales of pirate wealth lure him to the port of M\u00eal\u00e9e with high hopes, no money, and insatiable curiosity. If clever enough, he will win the confidence of M\u00eal\u00e9e's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.",
