        "synopsis": "This is a point-and-click adventure game in which players assume the roles of heroes on a quest to obtain a magical artifact. Players traverse fantasy environments, interact with various characters, and collect items to complete mission objectives. A handful of sequences depict acts of violence: characters getting knocked out by blows to the head; a character getting turned to stone; characters using magic to battle a robot golem. The dialogue contains brief references to sexual material (e.g., \u201cYou see we never had 'sex' . . . at least not to my knowledge\u201d; \u201cHooker with a heart! Happy ending! All my inventions\u201d; \u201c[G]o whoring around with someone else.\u201d). Some female characters are also depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and/or with jiggling breasts. One mini-game depicts players' character drunk (i.e., screen-blurring effect) while attempting to punch an adversary; a few sequences depict a character smoking a pipe. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in dialogue."
