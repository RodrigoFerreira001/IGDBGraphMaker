    "summary": "The award-winning, suspense-horror, action-adventure game gives players an open-world experience, featuring detailed interactions with Greenvale locals, as well as numerous side quests and mini games to help solve the murders and uncover hidden town secrets. \n \nPlaying as special agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York\u2014everyone else does), players must investigate the brutal murder of a young local beauty. Amidst the backdrop of soaring mountains and a small American town, York must solve the mystery of the Red Seed Murders and stay alive in a place where supernatural creatures and a killer seek to end his investigation. \n \nImmerse yourself in the dark depths of Deadly Premonition with the Classified Edition's collectible contents. Dive deep into the creative process behind the game with a 30+ page hardcover art book, which features more than 50 pieces of concept, process, and final artwork. \n \nFeel like you're part of the world, listening to the 25-song original soundtrack while you sip on your coffee and play a game of poker with the completely custom 54-card Bicycle brand card deck. Of course, you could always throw the soundtrack into a Walkman and wander down a creepy road all alone instead... \n \nAnd to ensure you have the most complete Deadly Premonition experience possible, you'll also receive a DLC voucher along with your copy of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut for PS3, so you won't miss an ounce of the fun.",
