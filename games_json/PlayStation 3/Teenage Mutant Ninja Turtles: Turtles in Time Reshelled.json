    "summary": "One of the best games in the TMNT franchise returns with this downloadable 3D remake. \n \nThe Turtles have come up against some tough stuff in the past, but there's no comparison to what they're about to encounter. While sitting around the sewer watching television, Raphael, Donatello, and the crew witness a giant android ripping the Statue of Liberty from the ground, terrifying hundreds of tourists. Use pizza power-ups and huge body slams to make your way backwards and forwards through history in an attempt to restore peace to the Big Apple.",
