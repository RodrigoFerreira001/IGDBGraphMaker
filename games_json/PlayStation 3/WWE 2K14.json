        "synopsis": "This is a wrestling simulation game in which players can select real-world competitors from the WWE roster, compete in matches, and progress through multiple storylines. Players perform a variety of wrestling moves (e.g., grapples, holds, throws), as well as punching and kicking attacks. Sledgehammers, chairs, and tables can also be used to strike opponents; blood sometimes appears on wrestlers' faces. Some women are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; female wrestlers occasionally make provocative gestures (e.g., pelvic thrusts, wiggling their buttocks in front of opponents' faces as a taunt). During the course of the game, a handful of sequences depict/reference alcohol: a wrestler wearing a \u201cDrink Beer\u201d shirt and spraying his opponents with a \u201cbeer truck\u201d hose; a wrestler drinking from beer cans. One video clip briefly depicts the word \u201csh*t\u201d on a fan's sign, and a wrestler can be seen sticking out his middle fingers."
