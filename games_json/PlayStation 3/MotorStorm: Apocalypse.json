        "synopsis": "This is a street racing game in which players drive customizable trucks, motorcycles, and cars through post-apocalyptic cityscapes. Players race through courses to compete for first place and can collide with obstacles and other drivers; crashes are sometimes accompanied by large explosions. In some sequences, players are able to run over pedestrians, who react to damage with a rag-doll effect. Cutscenes sometimes depict characters being kicked, punched, or shot at. Some female characters are shown in low-cut tops that reveal large amounts of cleavage. In one cutscene, a woman adjusts her breasts while talking to another character (e.g., 'Hey, not many guys look me in the eye!'). The game also contains some bathroom humor: a cutscene in which several men talk while sitting in restroom stalls\u2014flatulence can be heard in the background. Players can access a picture gallery with descriptions for several characters: one image depicts a man named Chronic who holds an oversized cigarette; another character is described as once being 'in a haze of peyote and adrenaline.' The word 'sh*t' appears in the dialogue, and players' character sometimes taunts opponents by sticking out his middle finger."

    "summary": "MotorStorm: Apocalypse (released as MotorStorm 3 in Asia) is a 2011 racing 3D video game by Evolution Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It is the fourth game in the MotorStorm series and the third for the PlayStation 3. It was announced shortly before the beginning of the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 on the PlayStation Blog by Evolution Studios on 10 June 2010.[4] \n \nMotorStorm: Apocalypse was released in Europe on 16 March 2011[1] but the UK release on 18 March was delayed by Sony Computer Entertainment UK following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[5] The Australian launch went ahead as planned on 17 March, but Sony announced further shipments of the game to that country would be halted in the wake of the disaster. The planned North American release date of 12 April 2011[3] was delayed by Sony[6] who later confirmed new releases dates of 31 March 2011 in the UK[2] and 3 May 2011 in North America.[7]",
