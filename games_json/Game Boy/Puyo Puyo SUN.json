    "summary": "This is the 3rd installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu. After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of Tsu. \nThe name of Puyo Puyo SUN comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (\u4e09)) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes. \nThis game was released only in Japan.",
