You and your furry little buddy Jerry must dash, jump, and climb from the basement up through every level of the house to rescue him in time. \n \nJerry's main defense is his unlimited supply of marbles. Pick up other items such as bubble gum, meat cleaver, cups of water, moth balls, hammer, invisible ink and drill to overcome the enemies and obstacles in your way. Make sure you outwit Tom whenever he appears.",
