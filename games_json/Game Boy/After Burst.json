Each level only has one screen to blast hostile robots, solve challenging platforms, and manipulate a series of short puzzles. \n \n30 stages await players as they look forward to a boss battle on every tenth stage. A weapon is available; its gunfire can be altered by changing the angle of the gun. Even the distance of the shot can be changed by holding down the button for extended periods of time.",
