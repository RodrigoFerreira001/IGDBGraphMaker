Combat is RPG/Strategy oriented, as the player chooses when to move, charge energy, punch, kick, or do any number of different special attacks, then watches as the events take place. You must take an active part in dodging attacks by pressing appropriate buttons at just the right moments. Fight to save the Earth from Vegita, or just face off against the other Z soldiers in a Tenkaichi Budokai tournament.",
