EARTHWORM JIM: Menace 2 the Galaxy is the second Game Boy Color adventure for everyone's favorite worm-turned-superhero. Playing as Jim in this one-player action game, you must blast your way through 12 bizarre stages packed with enemies and other hazards. To aid you in your endeavor, you'll be able to pick up and use four different weapons to toast your foes. The typical wry humor present in the EARTHWORM JIM series is here as well, resulting in some crazy situations for you to jump, shoot, and fly your way through. Although EARTHWORM JIM: Menace 2 the Galaxy is compatible with all Game Boy systems, it includes a special exclusive level when played on Game Boy Color.",
