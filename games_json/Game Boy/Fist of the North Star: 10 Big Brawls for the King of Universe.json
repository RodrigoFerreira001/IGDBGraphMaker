    "summary": "Fist of the North Star: 10 Big Brawls for the King of Universe is a one-on-one fighting game for the Game Boy developed by Shouei System and originally released by Toei Animation in Japan on December 22, 1989. An American version was released by Electro Brain on April 1990, making it one of the few Hokuto no Ken video games released overseas. Other than a different title screen (which features a new artwork depicting Kenshiro and Raoh similar to the cover art of the first Famicom game), the two versions are otherwise identical.",
