When you completely enclose a geometric shape, it turns to show an image fragment. Your objective is to return the entire image pieces without getting hit by the creatures that lurk in the level. These pass through the walls and throw projectiles that you need to ensure dodge them too. Finishing a level, you can admire the sketch as a whole and move to the next stage. Bonus items appear occasionally to freeze your enemies for example. It is also possible to defeat an opponent by turning a piece of image as it passes over.",
