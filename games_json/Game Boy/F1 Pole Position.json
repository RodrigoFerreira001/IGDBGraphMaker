    "summary": "The actual names of the drivers are not used due to licensing arrangements. There are sixteen rounds divided in eight levels. Each level has a special rival to beat. The game structure has similarities with F-1 Race (Game Boy), but this time it requires a certain ability to control the Formula One car. Levels become more difficult because the rival becomes increasingly strong.",
