    "summary": "A police officer named Tony and his sister are forced to go inside an unidentified flying object by a group of aliens who are planning to invade the galaxy. They are later exiled to a distant planet after refusing to engage in espionage for their side. \n \nTony finds himself stranded on a strange planet where nothing is familiar (and without his sister). However, a mech that has a vast knowledge of telepathic skills saves him and empowers Tony with the ability to take on the aliens' army. This machine becomes an important ally in the battle to save Tony's sister and stop the extraterrestrial invasion before it's too late. The game forces players to fight strange aliens across the galaxy. Players collect power-ups while in the mech but loses it after a single hit. The game includes some surreal enemies like a typical dog and some music notes.",
