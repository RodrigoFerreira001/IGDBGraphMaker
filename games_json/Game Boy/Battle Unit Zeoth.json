The Earth\u2019s forces were triumphant in battle and the Grein forces fled the Solar System. However, as they retreated, the Grein left behind a secret underground base filled with self-replicating Grein machines. \n \nForty-two years after the Earth\u2019s victory, the Grein base opened and a new attack force decimated the city of New Age. To retaliate, Earth\u2019s military has stored a mecha that specializes in alien combat known as the Zeoth. It is the Zeoth\u2019s assignment to stop the attack force, go into the Grein secret base and destroy the mechanical occupants before a new invasion force arrives.",
