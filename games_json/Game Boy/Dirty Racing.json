    "summary": "Dirty Racing is a top-down racing game, developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1993. \n \nAfter a race, you are awarded money based on what place you qualified in, which can be used to purchase nitrous, upgrade, or repair your car in a manner similar to Tradewest's Super Off Road. You then move around a board game-like map to choose your next race. \n \nDespite the game being Japanese exclusive, the entire game's text is in English. The game also shares another similarity with Super Off Road, that being scantily clad women who are shown when a race is finished.",
