The game is set in the future and it appears a major incident has transformed what used to be a peace-filled nation into a troubled land of waste and ruin. What exactly has happened in this land remains unknown but whatever it was, it has damaged the earth's surface. Now the entire location is immersed in water. Our gallant heroes must now protect the earth's remains from the dastardly evil empire that are planning to take over the world. Dolphin Blue is an action side-scrolling shoot-em up with great graphics, super sound and gripping gameplay that will leave you sitting on the edge of your dolphin!",
