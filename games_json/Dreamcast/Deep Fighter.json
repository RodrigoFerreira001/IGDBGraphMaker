    "summary": "As a private in the defense force by The General, players take on deadly missions to seek out and destroy enemies, perform reconnaissance into uncharted waters and rescue damaged craft and installations. Meanwhile, droids and drones scuttle around busily, maintaining and repairing the slowly crumbling city. \n \nWith the ultimate objective of the construction of a giant mothership, the Leviathan, that will transport the entire civilization away from hostile waters. \n \nThis games combines elements of furious 3-D dogfighting and challenging exploration in true 3-D environments. 3-D worlds actually react and evolve around you as the game's level of difficulty adapts to your skill level. \n \nFive life-like and realistic environments, including the Abyss, Atlantis, and Jungle. Dynamic modes of battle include 3-D combat, unique weapons, special attack moves and upgradable fighter submarines.",
