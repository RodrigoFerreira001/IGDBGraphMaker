    "summary": "Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact is a sequel to the Dreamcast launch title Godzilla Generations. Both are based on the famous Japanese movies series around the eponymous Godzilla, a giant dinosaur-like monster. \n \nThe game is a rail shooter like the famed Panzer Dragoon, where you move on a fixed path but can shoot in all directions to take down waves of approaching enemies. The game also features a dodge and a lock-on mechanic. The gameplay is divided in two kinds of levels. The first style features Godzilla rampaging through a Japanese city and taking down all kinds of military devices which try to stop him. The second kind of level is a fight between Godzilla and other giant monsters from the various films.",
